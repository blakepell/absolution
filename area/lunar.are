The naga sentinel has the upper body of a woman and the lower body of a

The devil shade looks like nothing more than a faint black distortion in
the air; however, the chill of the grave that it emanates can be easily
felt.  A coarse, cold, croaking sound emits from its lifeless lips, and it
stretches out tendrils, seeking the warmth of the living to feast upon.

Cold blue ghost fires surround this apparition of a beautiful woman. 
Although the face's beauty surpasses that of any mortals, it is repelling

that she has once seduced and killed.  The banshee brings death to all she
passes, and now she calls for you.

delicate and fragile.  His hair is cut short and stand on ends due to the
electricity.  He is clad in a voluminous dark blue robe that billows out
around him.  Lightning crackles around him, and they answer to his commands.

In the forest the tower lies,
Bathed in moonlight weathered by time.
Watching the moon through starry skies
As it plies through an endless mime.
 
Evil descended from the shores,
And it beseiged the tower fair.
It summoned form the haunted moors
Death shades and shadows of despair.
 
The walls have fallen to darkness,
Yet the tower stood defiant.
A focus place of holiness,
The garden withstood the giant.
 
In the haven the Seal awaited;
A harsh fate has been decided.
The darkness will he seal away
And forever hold it at bay.
 
The doors of time are locked to fate;
Until the sun and star shine bright,
The keys will lie in wait within
The double moons away from sight.
 
Isolated the tower stood
In the forest in silent sleep.
Nine millenia thus went by,
Forgotten in the forest deep.
 
In the forest the tower lies,
Bathed in moonlight weathered by time.
Watching the moon through starry skies
As it plies through an endless mime.

The Two Lunar Towers
 
      The Lunar Reading Tower lies within the centre of the 
Midnight Forest, a forest where the moon shines eternally.  This 
Lunar Tower is also known as the Order Tower, for it embodies 
small amounts of chaos, bound by order.  The tower contains eight 
stories and above the tower lies the floating lunar palace.  A mirror 
image of the Order Tower exists, however not on this plain, for the 
Chaos Tower embodies small amounts of order bound by chaos.  
Few know the entrance to the Chaos Tower, because it is a closely 
guarded secret.  Within the Chaos Tower, is a great sea of 
nothingness: the hollow emptiness of chaos.

The Seal of the Moon
 
      It has always been the duty of the Seals to keep eternal 
watch over the towers and the Lunar Keys.  The role of the Lunar 
Seal is a great responsibility, and it is passed from grandsire to 
grandson.  Yuelin is the current Seal, the seventh to bear that 
responsibility, after the death of his grandsire at the hands of the 
demons of chaos.  Though young, Yuelin was born on the night

The Chaos War (Part I)
 
      Throughout the history of the tower, the key of darkness 
has always drawn demons, for it radiates the will of all demons: 
destruction.  Normally the attacks are scattered and unorganized, 
and they were easily stopped.  On the sixth day of the sixth month, 
however, the moon was eclipsed by a shadow star, which showed a 
sign of ill omen.  A young maiden showed up at the tower on that 
day and asked for sanctuary.   Two lunar cycles later, a horde of 
demons lead by the demon lord Gurayos laid siege to the tower.  
The outer walls were easily taken, but the demons were repelled by 
the glow of the Jinyue Garden; one dark entity was able to breach 
the hallowed grounds.  
      Gurayos, through much cunning, managed to find the gates 
to the Chaos Tower, but the Lunar Seal was there waiting.  After a 
long battle, Gurayos slew the Seal and strode triumphantly into the 
tower.  He reached the inner heart, where the tears of darkness are 
kept and absorbed the essence of destruction.  Gurayos did not stop 
there however, for he coveted the source of the tears: the Lunar 
Key of Darkness.

The Chaos War (Part II)
 
      Within the Inner Haven, Yuelin concentrated on erecting 
the shield to keep the demons at bay.  He heard his grandsire's last 
words: "The key is within his reach.  Will you make the sacrifice?"  
The sacrifice is the last resort in the defense of the Lunar Keys.  It 
will create a barrier, in which time does not exist, around the 
victim, and thus forever trapping him there.  The cost, however, 
exact the same fate upon the evoker.  There was no other 
alternative, and Yuelin knew that better than anyone.  The spell 
was cast, and a great roar of frustration and defeat thundered 
through the tower as Gurayos found that his efforts were 
destroyed.  The Lunar Reading Tower was sealed up and the 
demons that were not destroyed were trapped.  Thus the tower 
slept within the Midnight Forest.  All this time Yuelin watched 
over the tower in silence, imprisoned within the timeless barrier.

Concerning the Holy Moon Key
 
      The moon, like the world, exhibits two sides:  the light and 
the dark.  Two Lunar Keys were born during the third cycle of the 
moon, one to the dark side and the other to the light.  The Lunar 
Key of light represents the force of creation, beginning, and life; 
the Lunar Key of darkness represents the force of destruction, 
ending, and death.  Within the Lunar Reading Tower sleeps the 
key of light and within its mirror, the key of darkness.  The two 
keys shed essence of creation and destruction, and these are 
collected within frozen crystals of moonlight.   When both of the 
essences are united with the four runes of passage and bathed 
within the waters of the ever light and the life past, the Holy Moon 
Key will then be born.  The Holy Moon Key is an image of the two 
Lunar Keys, and it transcends land, sea, and air.  To it the doors to 
the Sun and Star will open, allowing passage.

The Chaos Tower
 
The Chaos Tower is the mirror image of the Lunar 
Reading Tower: it embodies order surrounded by 
chaos.  The Tower is filled with nothing, the 
emptiness of chaos, creating a natural maze.  The 
passage through the maze is written within the 
reflected surfaces of the Corridor of Mirrors.  Look 
first in the mirror whose shape has no beginning or 
end followed by the triangular mirror.  Next, look 
twice in the hexagonal mirror then the quadrilateral 
mirror.  The pentagonal mirror comes next before 
ending with three times the first mirror.

The River Passages
 
Displacement through the tower can be achieved
using the four River Passages.  Each passage 
corresponds to a phase of the moon and is guarded 
by a Keeper of the Watch.  The higher passages 
have access to the lower ones; thus, a person from 
the full moon passage may speak the word 
"gibbous", "half", or "crescent" to arrive at the 
respective passage.  The phases of the moon are 
crescent, half, greater, and full.  If a person exits the 
tower through the passages, he will be given a rune 
of passage.  The rune can be given to the Guardian 
of Gates, who keeps watch in the woods, and he
will return the person to the corresponding passage.

The Crescent Moon Staff
 
The Crescent Moon Staff is a powerful weapon that 
increases both the intellect and wisdom of the 
wielder.  The very nature of the staff is magical, 
which causes the staff to be drawn to magic like a 
moth to a flame.  With each successful hit, the staff 
will drain a portion of the opponent's magical 
powers, transferring them to the wielder.  The four 
components needed are scattered throughout the 
tower.  One can be found underneath the third of the 
black dragon's gray breath while another can be 
found in the scented ashes.  The beating heart 
carries one piece and so does the mirror image in 
the Realm of Reflections.

The Four Elemental Stones
 
Four elemental stones, fire, water, earth, and air, are 
hidden away in the greater moon level of the tower.  
Each has the ability of summoning its respective 
element when invoked.  When one of the stones is 
placed into its opposite element, the stone will have 
the ability to inhibit the opposing element: fire 
inhibits water, air inhibits earth, and so on.  If the 
four stones are united, they will meld into the 
Elemental Soul, a gem that augments the power of 
the wearer.

The Gem of Light
 
The Gem of Light is a powerful item that can banish

Light can destroy chaos only if the source of chaos 
is not in combat.  By holding high the Gem and 
possessing the Essence of Light, one need only 
speak "min kie" to activate the Gem's powers.  Not 
even the chaos of the daemon lords can withstand 
this power.

{WF{wul{Wl {YM{yoo{Yn{x~
The circular platform rises up from a wide expanse of the white desert
below.  Pillars of stone erupt from the edge of the platform and reach up
towards the star-studded skies.  High above the pillars, a giant blue globe
marked by streaks of white hangs in the darkness.  Swirls of pink and
magenta nebulae dot the blackness of space, creating a sharp contrast to the
blue globe.  Stars twinkle like precious gems: some as small as grains of
sand, while others, as large as a pebble.  Moonlight floods into the area,
bathing it in a soft pale blue glow.  Upon the floor is a mosaic showing the
many phases of the moon as it makes its journey across the night sky.  Water
flows out from dragon shaped fountain along the edge of the platform and
falls down to the desert like rivers of falling stars.

The {DMidnight{x Path~
This marble paved path has long been lost in the flow of time.  Wild
grass and flowers have sprouted through the cracks in the stone and dance in
the cool breeze.  The branches of the cypress trees that line the path reach
out to each other, creating a calm shadow world beneath.  Night reigns
eternally here, and shafts of moonlight fall through the dense foliage,
which is the only form of illumination.  What appears to be a battlement
lies to the north.

The forest grows dense, and the sky is no longer visible.  Other than the
soft rustling of the leaves, the path is deathly silent.  Tiny fireflies
flutter across the path making eerie green will-of-the-wisps that flicker,
disappear, and reappear.  The arched gates lie to the north, and the forest
thins out to the south.

The {wLunar {xArchway~
The path terminates at a gigantic archway, the wall extending to both the
east and west and disappearing into the woods.  The archway is made out of
pure black obsidian and reflects the moonlight, illuminating the area. 
Pictures of ancient battles, mythical monsters, and legendary heroes are
finely chiseled around the archway.  A garden leading up to a tall tower
lies to the north of the arch while the forest continues to the south. 
Black staircases on either side of the arch lead up to the battlements.  The
dense growth of trees to the east and west makes passage impassable in those
directions.

The air is much cooler on top of the battlements, and the elevation
provides a fabulous view of the surroundings.  A sea of dark trees as far as
the eye can see stretches out around the battlement, creating a strong
contrast to the brightly lit tower that lies to the north.  The battlement
continues to the east and west, and stairs leads down below.

Eastern Sentry Pass~
Gigantic granite statues of gargoyles line the battlement, each holding a
gigantic halberd and glowering at any person who walks by.  The gargoyles
look almost life like, as if they are about to take a step or draw a breath.
A quiet groaning sound can be heard on the heavy night air, but it neither
comes from the forest nor the tower; the sound seems to emanate from the
statues themselves.  The battlement continues both northwards and westwards.

Eastern Battlement~
Parts of this battlement have crumbled away under the strain of time,
making it hazardous to walk along it.  Bits of obsidian lie haphazardly on
the ground, sometimes concealing places where the floor has fallen.  The
groaning sounds of the sentinels to the south can still be heard, but
another sound has joined in; the sound is a cold coarse croaking gurgle that
cannot come from the living.  The battlement ends at the watchtower to the
north while the sentinel pass can be seen to the south.

been many ages since the last Guardian of the Watch stood guard here.  Arrow
slits along the walls provide a sweeping view of the forest, although
scarcely anything can be discerned in the darkness.  The air grows dense,
and the sound of faint footsteps can be heard upon the air.  The battlement

Jinyue flower reflects the moonlight with their mirror like petals,

heavenly galaxy, pours out.  Two small glades can be seen to the east and
west while the Lunar Archway lies to the south.  To the north the yawning
gates of the tower awaits.

the moon.  Two doors can be seen to the east and west.  To the south is the

This is a small meditation chamber for those who seek the foresight of
the moon.  Tiny crucibles holding three sticks of incense are carefully laid
out around a mosaic of a crescent moon in the middle of the floor.  The soft

to take a toll on the physical body.  The only exit out of this room is the

Between the Shelves~
Hundreds upon hundreds of books occupy the shelves, from the floor all
the way to the top.  Large volumes of leather bound books are placed beside
ancient scrolls and manuals, and wooden tablets are carefully placed beside
sheets of papyrus.  This shelf has been accessed by many people, for not a
single grain of dust can be found in the vicinity.  The only exit is to the
east.

Among the Books~
Ancient tomes are carefully placed upon the shelves, which tower high
above.  The air is heavier in this part of the library and carries the aroma
of herbs and flowers.  This is the depository of hundreds of years of
knowledge in herbal lore; its scrolls containing the answer to those
interested in the healing arts.  Westwards is the only way out from these
shelves.

Deep Within the Library~
The continuous expanse of shelves envelops this section of the library in
a forest of books.  The shelves to the east and west seem to have not been
accessed as much as the previous ones; the dust from the two wings has
partly seeped into this hallway.  The exit lies to the south, and what
appears to be an alcove with a desk lies to the north.

A Forgotten Section~
It has been what appear to be ages since a sentient being has come to
this part of the library.  Cobwebs hang in abundance here among the dense
layer of grayish white dust.  The silver strands of the cobwebs reflect the
soft blue glow from the spheres and glitter like fine shafts of light.  The
central hallway of the library lies to the east.

A fine coat of grayish white dust covers this section of the library. 
Any sudden movement causes the dust to be swirled up into the air, obscuring
sight.  Scrolls occupy the many crevices on the shelves here, most of them
still sealed with wax.  A magical aura can be sensed, emitting from a few of
scrolls.  The library lies to the west.

A Silent Retreat~
The orbs of light that have illuminated the rest of the library does not
reach this far corner of the library; instead this silent area is lit by the
moonlight that falls through a large round window located high up in the
wall.  The light that seeps into this section is bright enough for the
wandering scholar to sit down and read the vast tomes of knowledge in peace.
A comfortable looking couch sits against the wall, near a pedestal holding
an ornate book.

Two dominate colours compose this picture: black and 
green. To the left of the painting is a barren wasteland 
strewn with dark, dead husky tree trunks. The ground is 
blackened as if it has been charred to cinders: a horrible 
landscape of catastrophe. To the right of the painting, 
however, is a lush vibrant forest. The green branches 
reaching up to the sky, creating a canopy for the small 
flowers beneath. The ground, as well as the tree is 
carpeted with a healthy layer of green moss. The two sides 
of the painting are not absolute, though, for within the 
wasteland, small green plants, barely visible, have started to 
sprout. Within the forest, small sections of dead wood can 
be seen, as the forest slowly walks down the path to death. 
The painting represents the eternal cycle between creation 
and destruction, life an death.

A Ba-Gua symbol is the central focus of this painting. Two 
small fish like patterns, one white and one black, entwine 
around each other forming a circle at the centre of the 
painting. Within each small fish pattern, is a dot of the 
opposite colour, making up the Yin Yang symbol. Around 
this symbol are the eight Gua, combinations of three lines, 
either solid or broken, carefully painted using golden paint. 
The symbol represents the good as well as the bad, 
co-existing in harmony, there are no absolutes.

The painting captures a still life of an ancient willow tree.  
The soft willow branches erupt from the top of the trunk and 
fall down like a mane of green hair.  The tree stands on top 
of a green hill, and swirls of clouds roll by behind it.  A 
superficial glance at the painting would reveal it to be rather 
plain; however every foliage, to every branch, and to every 
pattern on the tree bark is symmetrical on both sides of the 
tree.

Within this painting, a golden scale stands admist a sea of

seem to come alive and dance on top of the canvas. In 
each of its plates lie six gems: the ruby, the amber, the 
topaz, the emerald, the sapphire, and the amethyst. The

The violent gusts of wind that envelop this floor halt abruptly as they
approach this northern section.  Two giant columns rise up from the ground,
standing to the sides of an arched gateway.  Carved within the marble
stones, around the doorway, are depictions of plants that intertwine around
the edges.  Tiny carved cherubs rest among the plants, and seem to come to
life as the flickering light from the mirrors touch them.  The room within
is relatively darker compared to this, but an aura of warmth emanates from
it.  The corridor of mirrors lies to the east and west.

garden lies beneath to the south and the midnight forest beyond the garden. 
A round basin of water lies within the centre of the room, beneath an

crescent moon, each facing a different direction to redirect the moonlight.

damaged, as if by some creature.  The steps have been worn and at some
places, made smooth even.  Above, the tower rises towards the star filled

that remains now is a platform strewn with holes and depressions;
nevertheless, this landing still serves as a good vantage point.  Down below
lies a small straw thatched hut, the Jinyue garden glitters to the south,
and lastly a small path leads northwards into a grove.  The sea of trees
sways slightly within the breeze as if threatening to engulf all of the
tower's surroundings.  The spiral staircase leads both upwards and down: up
towards the tower, and down towards the hut.

A gray stone cobbled path lies below the spiral staircase, creating a

small grasses and herbs to sprout from between the stones, and they sway as
if in a dance within the wind.  A small hut lies not far to the west, and a
thin wisp of smoke can be seen rising from a metal chimney.  A dense thicket
blocks the way southwards.  To the north, a trail can be seen through the
plants, leading north.

is covered by a thick layer of yellow straw.  A round hearth has been dug in
the middle of the room and is surrounded by a ring of round stones.  A large
cauldron hangs from a hook on top of the hearth and a sweet smelling scent
diffuses from the bubbling liquid within.  The walls are covered with many
shelves and cupboards, filled with many jars.  Strange though, many of the
jars are empty.  Upon a small table by the room lie numerous tools and
devices such as a pestle and mortar, numerous knives, and other various
equipments.

much like the midnight forest.  Many of the trees have been splintered by
some large moving creature and now lie strewn upon the ground like corpses. 
Many holes cover this area, and the faint sounds of something tunneling
underneath can be heard.  The path terminates at a quiet glade to the north,
enclosed within a set of iron gates.  The obsidian staircase lies to the

The dense trees part, giving way to a grove, only sparsely populated by
short fruit trees.  Small fruits can be seen hanging from the branches,
however the trees are still in bloom.  Around the tree are patches of herbs,
some of which are so exotic that they do not seem to be from this world. 
The ground feels strange underneath.  The creeping noise that pervades south
of here does not touch the grove at all, and the unnatural silence lends a
haunted air to this otherwise peaceful grove.

off by the many orbs of light around the room.  At the north of the room is

staircase as if it is ready to pounce on anything that goes by.  The faint
sound of breathing along with the odd snarls can be heard upon the wind, yet
the wind makes it impossible to tell from where they come from.  A landing

The {DDark{x Chamber~
The vast room is like the floor of the ocean: cold and intensely dark. 
No windows can be found along the walls to let even a small shaft of
moonlight within.  In fact, it is not even certain that there are any walls
present.  The doorway that leads to the atrium can be seen to the south,
although the light coming through it disappears as soon as it places a step
into the room.  A voice can be heard in the room, although it does not emit
from any lips.

Testament of Strength~
Darkness engulfs everything except for this small circular platform
surrounded by a circular arrangement of short burning flames.  Lines that
seem to be made of molten gold flow from one flame to the next, creating a
complex pentacle within the circular platform.  In the centre of the room
stands a ten cubits tall stone statue, standing atop a seven cubit tall
pentagonal pedestal.  The statue is that of a warrior who is clad in a suit
of ornate combat armour, his face hidden behind a great horned helmet.  In
his right hand he wields a sharp axe, and he grasps a shield in the other.

A Polymorphic Passage~
The passage bends and distorts before the very eyes: confusing the senses
and disorienting the mind.  Not only does the physical shape of the path
alters but so does it's texture.  The path shifts from being a stone paved
street, to a dirt path, and even a stream of water.  In all, the path does
not seem to be from the natural plain.  Around the path, both up above and
down below, is a black void strewn with beams of polychromatic auroras.  The
door that leads into the room cannot be seen anywhere; however, a door can
be seen to the east, although it's position seems to shift ever so slightly.

Large arched windows that reach up towards the ceiling of the room line
three of the walls.  Long colonades are set between the windows, each carved
to resemble vines entwining around a tree.  A gigantic half moon has been
carved out of the great stones that makes up the domed ceiling.  To the
east, lies a gateway surrounded by strange sculptures of the most disturbing
nature.  Through the gateway, all that can be seen are patterns of
polychromatic shapes.  Another doorway can be seen in the south wall, which
leads out to a platform.

Greater Moon Gateway~
The ledge stretches out from the tower into the sky, eventually
terminating at a set of long staircases.  The railings along the passage
contain many statues of small gargoyles that watch the path in silence.  Two
dragon-shaped pedestals stand on either sides of the staircase, and in each
dragon's mouth burns a single blue flame.  Although there are no physical
gates, the blue aura that that surrounds the moon gates can be clearly seen
between the two dragon pedestals.  The stairs lead upwards towards the
heavens, encircling the obsidian tower.  Pillars erupt from the lower parts
of the tower to rise and support the staircase while other pillars surround
it, each topped with an obsidian statue.

Greater Moon Landing~
The wind howls incessantly around the stone staircase as it climbs high
above the ground below.  The staircase, unlike the tower, which is made of
obsidian, is constructed out of white marble such that it gives the
impression of a white dragon encircling the tower.  Around, mighty columns
of increasing heights erupt from the lower roofs of the tower as if forming
a barrier to protect the steps.  A statue adorns the pinnacle of each
column: statues of gods, humans, animals, and even daemons.  Some looks down
benevolently, some looks down apathetically, and some looks down
malevolently.  The stairs level off, and the passage continues eastwards,
while another passage leads northwards into the tower.

The wind still blows strong and cold, however, it seems to swirl out from a
single source to the east of the steps.  To the north, arches can be seen
rising up to provide support to the rest of the passage high above.  The
passage turns upwards, becoming steps leading up to the passage above.

of an archaic temple.  The floor is made of one unbroken piece of
white-laced black obsidian, providing a sharp contrast to the white marble

which lead to chambers of the initiates of the tower.  To the south, the

arched doorways.  The doors are made of tough red wood, each with a small
window high up in it.  Each door has a unique rune sigil inscribed onto it,
which glow with a magical aura.  The heavy red wood doors are shut tight,
but the quiet sounds of chanting can be heard coming from within.  The
hallway continues to the north and south.

The white walls of the corridor continue eastwards and westwards.  A
large golden frame dominates the northern wall of this corridor.  A
painting, painted with all the colours of the spectrum, resides within the
frame.  The painting shows many things: the heaven, the earth, the sea and
people.  The colours move and change, and the figures in the painting come
to life.  As time passes the painting gradually disappears only to be
replace by a new one.  A flight of white marble steps lies to the south.

look mural~
The mural shifts through the ages, revealing the rise and fall of 
kingdoms.  It shows the story of Eclipse, its obsidian halls now 
faded with the passage of time; images of the dragon war appear, 
bloody scenes where the Dragon Sea ran red with blood. Many 
other events cover the mural as it slowly tells time's never-ending 
tale.
 
One of the scenes depicts the winter solstice when the Lunar 
Reading Tower has been completed.  The tower has been built to 
house the two Lunar Keys, watching over them, as they shed 
essences of creation and destruction: a proper balance must be kept 
lest chaos engulfs the world.  On that winter's eve, the white lunar 
dragon descended from the heavens and blessed the tower, offering 
it his protection.  As the mural changes, it tells about the Lunar 
Dragon Cloak, the most sacred relic that has received this blessing.  
The cloak can only be created by gathering the items of power.  
First there is the dragon wings to provide protection and structure.  
Then there are the two essences of creation and destruction to 
provide power.  The five magical potions, representing light, 
protection, healing, illusion, and beginning, are required to unite 
the forces. Three Jinyue petals, representing time, past, present, 
and future, will contain the forces, and finally, a gem of the 
elements brings about balance.

illuminated by a two single orbs of light that float slightly above it.  The
desk does not fare better than the bed, for it is littered with books,
scrolls and writing implements; the same goes for the floor.

certain times and other arches at other times.  Large round glass lenses are
suspended in the air in the middle of the circle of stones.  Through the
lenses, which could be moved at will to face different directions, the
celestial bodies can be seen greatly amplified.

plants would sprout from a seed rapidly mature, die, and decompose, only to
be born again.  Some of the other plants seem to be frozen like statues, as
if suspended in time.

Temple of {wSpirit{x~
The octagonal room is divided into eight different sectors, spreading out
from a central globe in the centre of the room.  Many swirling portraits of
psychedelic colours hang upon each panel of the walls.  The colours affect
the mind in many peculiar ways: swirling red colours invoke anger, mellow
blue colours invoke calmness, and churning yellow colours invoke joy.  Many
recliners are placed around the room, and books are scattered across the
single table in the room.

Asylum of {yInfinity{x~
Infinity borders chaos and the void, and the Asylum of Infinity emulates
this statement.  The room is a bubble of reality that floats through the
blackness of space.  The floor of the room is shaped in the form of a
crescent moon, and an invisible force shield blocks any attempt of stepping
out into infinity.  Infinity, however, is not completely empty of material. 
Stars float across the blackness, and swirls of nebulae seem to bind the
stars together.  The infinite dance of the stars creates much vertigo and
poses the question whether or not it is infinity dancing around order, or is
order dancing around infinity.

A {bBlue{x Whirlwind~
A still place lies within the eye of the vortex.  The 
wind, tinged with a blue colour, howls around this 
small space, separating it from the rest of the world. 
Being carried upon the wind, the chains that tie living
things down to the earth are released, improving the
recovery of the body and spirit.  Up above, the stars,
which twinkle like diamonds, can be seen through the
round eye of the whirlwind.  Down below, the world
seems like a giant tapestry of colours.

Realm of Reflections~
The wall of this chamber is made of thousands of 
mirrors, each with a different shape and size. The floor 
of this room is one gigantic unbroken mirror creating 
the illusion that there is no floor.  The room seems as if 
it is the inside of an enormous diamond.  The 
multitude of reflections in the room give the 
misconception of walls where there are none and 
passages where there are walls.  The reflections in
the mirrors are strange, however, for they do not move
with the same synchonization as the person who has 
cast it.

Sanctum of {gForest{x~
Many plants inhabit this room giving it the appearance of a lush forest
rather than a simple room.  A wide array of nocturnal plants is carefully
cultivated on the outer rim of this room, each bearing luminescent fruits. 
These plants tower over the group of green daytime plants, forming a canopy
of light.  Many flowers bloom in this sanctum: peonies, roses,
chrysanthemums, and many other more exotic ones.  In the far corner of this
room are a group of carnivorous plants that snap at the air, waiting for
unsuspecting victims.  Thick strands of vine coils around a door in the
northern wall.

The temperature drops drastically within this room, and one's breath can
be seen condensing into fog.  Blue ice crystals form a prismatic matrix
around the room, becoming the walls, floor, and ceiling.  A stone walkway
encircles the room, providing passage over the pond of clear water.  Within
the heart of the room, water springs forth from a dragon shaped fountain. 
Many exotic fish swim in the pool, and they sometimes jump out of the water,
creating ripples on the otherwise still surface.

A strong wind constantly blows in the interior of this room.  A barrier
of mist shrouds the walls of this room, leaving ambiguities as to how far it
stretches.  White cumulus clouds roll by high above, darkening in shade as
the altitude increases.  At the very pinnacle of the room, blue and white
lightning arcs between the clouds causing shockwaves that shake the room.

Chapel of {mEarth{x~
The room takes on the form of an underground cavern, with rocks and earth
as its walls and floor.  Burning torches set in the walls fill the room with
a dim light.  Water drips from various stalactites in the ceiling of the
cavern into dark ponds below, where corresponding stalagmites emerge.  The
walls are studded with veins of minerals that run along them like rivers. 
Crystals to match all the colours in the visible spectrum hang from the
ceiling and walls as well as erupting from the ground.  Gigantic fungi grow
on the rich soil as well, adding their colours to those of the crystals,
enhancing their beauty.

The walls of this room are made from black obsidian 
and they seem to disappear into the darkness.  Dust 
lies heavily upon this room, which has been long 
forgotten.  Seven statues of maidens are placed in a 
circle around the centre of the room.  Each statue 
stands over a dozen cubits in height and each bears 
a crystal orb, which matches one of the seven colour 
of the rainbow, in her hands.  Lines of fire run from the 
southern doorway towards the centre, providing the 
only source of light along with the seven orbs.  A 
mass of living green slime occupies the centre of the 
room.

the full moon have shut them out.

Here and there, massive hour, minute and second 
hands make their round, slowly ticking away the time.
The north end of this room lies a raised dais that

tiny frost crystals can be seen forming along parts of the invisible

The landing is constructed from thousands of pale stones, arranged in
concentric rings that ripple outwards from a central image of a full moon. 
Red wooden posts that have beams of the same material running between them
surround the landing, creating a barrier.  Down below, the world has
disappeared, replaced by a lake of shimmering stars that flow like liquid
silver.  To west and east are two spires of opposite colours: one black and
one white.  To the north a wooden bridge leads across the sky to a large
palace.

from the rest of the room and is surrounded by spinning platforms, shaped
into planets and moons.  A large telescope made of platinum lies within the
centre of this room, and it points towards the cold blue moon above.  Upon

An elaborate palace dominates this large floating platform, which lies
above the lake of stars.  Curved gold and orange tiles are fitted along the
roof of the palace, slanting downwards in cascades of the two colours.  A
set of cedar walkways surrounds the exterior of the palace.  The palace
itself, at least the part that can be seen, is made of white oak that have
been carefully cultivated to grow into the desired shapes.  The moon that
hangs up in the sky has grown greatly in size as the distant to it has been
decreased, and now it lies behind the palace forming a blue mirror.  A path
leads to the palace gates, and upon it are images of dragons, phoenixes, and
many other mystical creatures, carefully chiseled into the stone.

green lily pads.  There are no walls to either side of the atrium, but
panels covered with richly painted paper occupy the stretch between the
pillars.  Most of the panels are slid open to reveal terraces that lead out
to the night sky and overlook the world below.  Countless moonflower petals
dance through the air of this atrium, carried on by soft gusts of wind.  To

diamond.  A pentacle lies in the centre of the gems, and it emits an upwards
beam of silver light.  The only exits are by the stairs downwards or upwards

cities can be seen as glowing patches on the faint horizon, and rivers can

Chaos~
Chaos, that which is beyond the edge reality, is where everything is born
and where everything will eventually return.  A sea of blackness stretches
infinitely on all sides: colourless, soundless, and lifeless; it is
everything, and it is nothing.  It is the paramount form of things, the
ultimate perfection where there is no suffering.  There are no restrictions
in chaos, and one can go everywhere one wishes, if one ever move at all or
exist, for that matter.

Ascension of the Dark Moon~
A gray temple like structure stands to the north of this strange setting.
On top of a raised dais, gargantuan columns rise up to disappear into the
darkness.  Thousands upon thousands of alien glyphs cover the massive
columns from top to bottom, as if choking them.  A burning darkness, shaped
in the form of an inverted crescent moon, floats above the temple entrance. 
A foul air permeates this area, and it grows stronger closer to the temple. 
Stone steps lead into the temple, and they appear to be the only passage
available, for an impenetrable darkness surrounds this place on all sides.

Chaos Haven~
Seven orbs of darkness, each matching one of the colours of the rainbow,
floats above thin crystal pedestals at each corner of the star shaped floor.
The crystalline star floats through the emptiness of chaos.  Emotions are
carried on the frantic aura that permeates the room: hate, envy, greed, and
anger.  These emotions are so intense that they can almost be sensed as a
physical barrier in the air.  This is the Chaos Haven, the most corrupted
heart of the dark moon.

A platform made of paved stone blocks lies in the middle of a vast empty
plain that stretches out on all sides.  The world can be seen now as a great
blue sphere laced with white and green high above.  Stars adorn the
blackness of space like tiny fireflies, flickering brightly within the
emptiness.  A stream of flowing water leads northwards, and trong waves of
energy can be sensed pouring down from that direction.  A single blue ring
leads back to the Inner Haven.

A Discrepancy~
A strange environment spreads out in all directions.  The scene is
dominated by a single gray stone like road with a dotted white lines drawn
down the centre To the west lies a tall square building enclosed by a brick
wall.  Around, immensely tall towers rise up from the ground, and they seem
to touch the sky.  Far to the north, behind all the high towers, is a tall
pyramidal structure made of red steel.  All around, people dressed in
strange clothing are slowly filing into the first building on to the west.
