Tyger's Humble Abode~
The sweet scent of lilac wafts through the air as you appear in the room.
As your senses grasp the reality of the room, you notice a comfortable
looking sofa and table set.  The walls are covered in a deep shade of green
paint, giving the room an earthy look to it.

tunnels.

In front of a door~
A back door, made of stone, halts the journey to the north.  Smooth as
glass, the door looks easily breakable, but you doubt that even if given a
thousand years you couldn't put a chip in it.  Footprings of all shapes and
sizes have been marked in the dirt here.  You spot the occassional odd
footprint, and recognise it as being the footprint of an elf.

The Obsidian Gates~
Welcome to the Underspires.  Your first steps into the undergound
civilization send shivers down your spine.  Here in the underworld, a
subterranean civilization thrives, while the denizens of the surface world
remain ignorant of their existence.  Crowds of people push past you as they
rumble past you going to all sections of the city.  Try to remain calm and
and look inconspicous as you wander around.  Welcome to your new and final
home.

Main Street~
The pace of the city begins to pick up here.  Citizens of the
Underspires mill about the city heading off in unknown directions going to
unknown destinations.  Immediately to the west you see a rather plain, stone
building.  A closed door with a painted spear emblem leads to the inside. 
To the east however you notice a small crowd of dark elves have gathered in
front of a distant building.

The Academy Gates~
A small crowd of young dark elves have seemingly set up camp in front of
some closed gates.  Beyond the gates you see a plain, pearly white building.
You gather from the idle conversation of the crowd, that you stand before
the Academy.  Here, singled out students are trained here in the arts of
war, and only a select few are ever allowed entry.  You listen to the rumour
that only the best of the best ever make it in, and back out.

blood rising to your face making you looked flushed with embarrassment.

drow are taught their skills be it magic or weaponry.  Many a great warrior
have left the Academy and have gone on to bigger and better places.  The
floor has been tiled over in the lobby, and the giant spider of the drow god
has been imaged into the stone.

Ts'Rithanya Road and Main~
You've walked up towards a T-intersection.  To the west, you look down
Ts'Rithanya Road, while to the north you continue on the main strip.  To the
west, you can hear the distant music and merry-making, while to the north
you see a crowd of people milling through what seems to be the town square. 
The buildings along the street are fairly plain to the Underspires, they
also seem to have been built out of stone.  The buildings serve their
purpose as you see scores of people milling in and out of them.

Your wandering has led you to the intersection of Ts'Rithanya, and Pacet
Road.  Here, a few glow worms and glow bugs have been caught and placed in jars
to illuminate the street signs.  To the north, Pacet Road looks slightly
deserted, save for a few critters milling about.  Whereas to the east
and west, a few citizens go about their daily business.

Ts'Rithanya Road ~
Walking along a stretch of road, you notice that the buildings are
slightly bunched together.  The lack of dark alleys has greatly reduced
crime in the Underspires.  However, it is more than likely that an
under-movement of crime still exists.  On the north side of the street you
notice a two-story building.  A sickle and hammer has been carefully etched
into the door.  A few captured glow worms have been stuffed into jars and
placed just around the door, illuminating it from the darkness of the
cavern.

The Rivoli~
Crammed with locals and some strange looking merchants, the Rivoli
bustles about with an unseen energy.  Paintings from different artists have
been hung on the walls.  A game played with sticks and coloured balls on a
long table is being played by a few dark elves in the corner.  There is an
all around casual atmosphere, unlike the typical drow stereotype.

The City Square~
The city square of the Underspires bustles with people as they hurry
about with their errands.  Standing still allows you to be carried with the
flow of traffic.  Hawkers of every sort yell at the top of their lungs
trying to lure you to their wares.  A few guards standing nearby look for
troublemakers and help the movement of traffic.

Intersection of Alr'Chianthi and Main~
An intersection bustles with activity as people hurry from one side of
the city to the next.  Scores of people from all different races and
cultures hurry about the streets going about their lives.  Few people pay
attention to you, as adventurers are a silver a dozen.

see more of a bland looking hallway, and to the left more of the same
hallway.  In the distance though, you make out the shadowy outline of a
figure.  South however, returns you to the rest of the underground
civilization.

the room.  A few religious symbols however have been painted on the floor of
the room.  You don't recognize any of these symbols as being holy.

The heat from a forge greets you as you enter the room.  Hammering away
are a few muscular dark elves.  Their hammering sends an incessant ringing
into your ears.  An assortment of weapons line the shelves, from small
little daggers to great clubs.  All of them seem to be in perfect condition.
Looking about, you see a dark elf glaring at you from behind a desk.

sign on the east door depicts a laughing troll, while to the west a needle
and thread adorns that door.

A small bell chimes, alerting everyone to your presence.  As you stroll
through the door you, you notice one other person in the room.  As a small
drow peers above his spectacles, you casually take in the room.  Soft fabric
lies heaped near the wall, while dresses and all sorts of other garments
decorate a rack that is against the opposite wall.  Some hefty leather
clothing decorates the wall behind the shopkeeper, and a long counter
seperates you from him.  A little bit of light illuminates the room for all
the non-drow customers, but not enough to hurt the eyes of the shopkeeper.

from the outside cavern air.  Standing near it, is the grumbling curator.

A nice comfortable room has been set up for you to kick back your heels,

away in the fireplace, warming the room to a suitable temperature.  A medium

A nauseating green assaults your eyes as you step into the room. 
Painted a mottled green, much like the colour of the curator, has been used
to cover the walls and ceiling.  The furniture has also been covered in a
deeper shade of green making the room seem utterly gauche.  The only comfort
in the room is a nice bed which hopefully, will make you forget the ugliness
of the room.

pleased in your choice of bedding.  Perhaps getting a room might be in
order?

and a large bed are all that furnish the room.  A few candles burn brightly,

You try to adjust your eyes to the brightness of the room.  The room has
been painted solid white.  In fact, not only is the room painted solid white
but the furniture, floor, and even the back of the door is painted white. 
Luckily your hardened senses can make ou the bed located in teh far corner.
At least you think you can see a bed, although you won't know for sure unless
you try.  The starkness of the room begins to numb your mind, and you wonder
to yourself if you really did rent the wrong room afterall.

A narrow strip of road gets even darker as you head north.  The
flickering torches that line the streets have almost all gone out and there
don't seem to be any glow worms in sight.  Though the street is quiet and
somewhat deserted, it is well traveled and as a result also well kept. 
Small homes and stores sit on opposite sides of the street.  There seem to
be more homes in this area but many of them are off the street, and it would
seem unwise to deviate from your path.

It's cozy interior allows just enough light in from the streets to provide
shadows.  A small kitchen is near the back of the house, while the living
area is closer to the front.  A small staircase leads up to the bedrooms.
The lavatory is somewhere out back, but you don't feel the urge to investigate
and look for one.

bedrooms upstairs, and an outhouse in the back.  The sounds of running water
can be heard somewhere inside the house.

the other walls have been covered with heavy black sheets.  You resist the
urge to poke your fingers into the cages when you hear the throaty growls
coming from inside them.  A small desk is the only piece of furniture in the
room.  A sleek, veiled female looks at you with boredom.

get a bearing on where you have arrived.  From the shadows you can make out
a few outlines of some burly thugs.

that you are being watched.  You hear low grumbling and the hiss of someone

The decor of this room is a far cry from the disorderly mess down below, this
room was organized for maximum efficiency.  No furniture other than
the tables decorate the room.  There are no windows to look outside, a wise
choice considering what is being down here.  The bubbling chemicals almost
overwhelm you as you lean against the wall for support.  Some hanging plants
barely block your view of the grim looking drow staring at you.

to pulse eerily in the darkness of the cavern.  Stepping closer, you can
feel your last meal beginning to lurch in your stomach as you watch
thousands of glow worms squirm about in the belly of the lantern.
The glow worms have been jammed into the enormous lantern to provide
illumination for the area.  Looking to the north, you can make out the
bright lanterns of the Underspire's market place.  To the east you notice
the splendors of the city have begun to deteriorate.  To the west you can
see a few more stores selling mundane wares.

are a little low on the social scale.  To the west you notice a faint light,

A wave of heat threatens to roast you alive as you make your way towards

oxen drawn wagon.  Hammering away next to the forge, sweats a gigantic
minotaur.  He growls in acknowledgement as he eyes the weapons at your side.
A short dwarf next to him inspects the minotaur's handy work and points with
a stubby finger at minute flaws in the craftmanship.

The Market - South-East~
A dirty hawker screams at the top of his lungs for buyers to see his
wares.  Looking around him you see that he has but a small box booth with a
few animal cages set around it.  Most of the crowd seem to avoid him, while
other shopkeepers go about their business.

The Gnome Tent~
A crowd of onlookers have gathered in a semi circle around the tent of
several gnomes.  Strange metal objects lay prominently displayed on several
tables.  Complex scribblings have been scrawled over leaflets of parchment
which go flying about as the gnomes try to explain their contraptions.  The
laughter of the crowd only furthers the frustrations of the gnomes to try to
explain their devices to anyone who will listen.

The Bakery~
The smell of freshly baked goods helps a little in masking the smell of
the animal pens to the north.  Marketers flock to this stall in an attempt
to get at this stall's goods.  The elves running this stall bustle about in
an attempt to keep up with the orders of the citizens in the Underspires. 
You begin to salivate as you inspect the baked goods that have been put out
for sale.

The Pens~
It seems that no air gets through the pens to dilute the stench of dung
and sweat from the livestock crammed into the pens.  Here, farmers sell off
livestock to the wealthy citizens of the Underspires.  With the rapid growth
of the city's economy and population, the expansion of the market to hold
livestock has been sadly neglected.  A few duck-like creatures nip at your
ankles as you wander through their feed.

As you make your way through a crowd of shoppers, you find yourself

young dwarf has set up shop here selling exotic flowers and plants.  The
dwarf seems out of place in the Underspires but judging from the drow women
who flock to his stall, he is well known and makes a comfortable living.

A practice dummy has been placed in the centre of this square of the
market.  Sitting before it is a blind man waiting for any pupils to teach. 
Several sailors scoff at the blind trainer, but are quickly rebuked by quick
cuffs to the skull by the city guards.  You hear the faint whispers of the
name N'dul of Geb being muttered by the guards.

needs of their customers.  A young drow elf looks embarrassed as he stands
on a small platform while the dwarves match bits and pieces of armour to
suit his body.  A small crowd gathers here more to watch in amusement than
to buy anything.  A table has been set up nearby with a surly dwarf taking
any orders from potential customers.

boxes of merchandise lie scattered about.  Nothing of real interest is here,
but at least you have found a small place to rest.

Layers of dust covers everything about the room.  Piles of parchment
paper with arcane symbols are placed indiscriminantly on tables, chairs and
even the floor.  After a quick scan about the room, you see a long counter
at the far end of the room.  Getting closer you notice a gruff looking
druegar trying to jam some frogs into glass jars.  Peering closer at the
counter you notice in it, are displays of dried chickens, frogs, and even
cats!  You scratch your head in wonder at what this store could possibly
sell.

mob chaos.

A wooden landing serves as a dock that is currently under construction. 
With the new law allowing races other than drow to enter the Underspires,
the city has seen a huge boost in the economy.  With the new grossing
economy, the docks that once were part of the Underspires is being
restructured.  As dock workers scramble about trying to meet deadlines,
pedestrians and onlookers watch in ernest as large boats and ships try to
find docking space.

The river water causes the docked boats to gently bop up and down.  Deep
green in colour, the water seems fresh enough to drink, yet ominous enough
for you not to stick your hand in.  A bit of movement catches your eye just
to the left of you and upon closer inspection, you notice that the river
teems with life.

cavern is harsh and cold, but it lends itself as a place of temporary
tranquility from the nastiness of the surrounding waves.  A small crack in
the ceiling, and a rope ladder tells you that there is more than one exit.

temple looks to have been carved out of a single, enormous, piece of black
obsidian.  A few guards pause to look at you as they push commoners and
hawkers out of the area.

the walls in the vain hope that you can find a crack in it.  To your dismay
you find no crack, not even a joint where the foundations of the temple were
built upon.  Looking inside you see a large crowd has gathered.  Large
pillars with spider like creatures decorate columns while large tapestries
decorate the walls.  Unholy symbols placed in specific areas of the temple
ward off anything that may seek to harm the people within.

Your footsteps echo loudly against the marble tiles of the temple's main
hall.  The ceiling held up by beautiful columns of black onyx is a marvel of
the underworld.  A mosaic of millions of tiny tiles have been carefully
placed to portray a battle scene of ages gone by.  A black figure portrayed
prominently in the centre of the picture wields a weapon that seems to cut a
path through all her enemies.  The bleak nature of the picture itself send a
shiver down your spine.  A whisper of wind seeming from nowhere brushes past
your ear.

A sense of dread overcomes you as you step off the stairs and onto the
main altar.  Entirely dedicated to the Unnamed, the drow society built this
temple in honour to her, and now you, a foreigner dare step on her unholy
ground.  From this vantage point you see far out of the temple and into the
streets of the city.  A huge symbol of a spider has been carefully carved
into the floor of the altar.  Tapestries hang from the ceiling with text
that is so ancient, you're sure it came from the beginning of the gods.  A
single, raised slab of rock serves as a table.  Judging from the little
carvings in the stone and the jugs at the ends of the table, it serves as a
sacrificing altar as well.

Small but comfortable is the nature of the head priestess' room.  Here
the head priestess is allowed to rest in peace from her daily chores, though
servitude to Lioth is never really a chore.  A small but comfortable bed
lies against the east wall while a desk and chair face the south wall.  A
small dresser with a mirror on it is the only other furniture.  You decide
for yourself that you would like this room if there weren't so many acrane
symbols scrawled on the walls.

under the watchful eye of Lioth, the priestess could indulge in whatever her
fantasy was.  As like many of her predecessors, whips, chains and manacles
are well in stock here.  You see what seems to be a table with little knives
carefully laid out on top.  In the corner you see a strange looking chair
that has manacles everywhere and a strange looking device on its seat.  At
the opposite end is a small but comfortable looking bed.  Not much else is
of interest here.

A Study~
As your eyes adjust to the dim lighting, you begin to focus on the mounds
of paper and books that litter the entire area.  Dusty books of all sorts
sit on the furniture, untouched under what looks like a decade of dust.  You
hold your nose suppressing a sneeze as you notice a few robed drow busily
studying some of the opened books.

The Chemist~
Colourful liquids in bottles of all shapes and sizes fill the shelves
that line the walls into this room.  A few long tables in the middle of the
room hold a contraption of metal, glass and a bubbling liquid.  A few dark
elves run about the table, babbling incoherently at each other while
franticly twisting little knobs on the contraption.  At the far end of the
room, you notice a sly looking elf giving you the once over as you stand
stupidly in her store.

A low humming noise emanates from the somewhere in the room.  The walls
glow with an eerie light and seem to pulsate rhythmically.  You begin to
hear the faint bustle of the city emanating.  You listen to the chatter of
the citizens of the Underspires.  The whisperings and the clamour of the
city would make a person go insane, but for some reason you seem at peace.

intrusion.  Various symbols have been carved into the door.  Judging by the

protection wards.

Several large chairs have been in a circular fashion near one corner, while
directly opposite seemingly to stare at the non-existant occupants stands a
large statue of a spider.  Smooth pebbles of all shapes and sizes have been
carefully placed on the ground and serves a decorative tile for the room. 
To the north you make out another large room.

A Hall~
A large dining room table looks to seat roughly about forty guests.  The
room itself would have at least twenty or so more servants who would stand
near the seated guests.  The room contrary to the dark colours of the other
rooms in the house has been painted a healthy red with a small border of
beige that outlines the room.  Several small tables around the room have
been placed against the walls and look to serve as serving stations for the
servants.  The large dining room table looks to be made of a solid oak. 
Skulls of beasts carved from the wood serves as leg posts while a beautiful
etching of elves killing surface dwarves details the top of the table.  You
decide the room can be described simply as extravagant.

the far wall raised on a a small stage is a large ornate chair which serves
as a throne.  Aside from the chair and table, there is no other furniture. 
A few small burning braziers dimly light the dark room but you find the
light does little to alleviate the tension you feel by entering the room.

You have managed to stumble into a hallway that seems closed off from the
rest of the house.  Lit by a small brazier, you can see that the hall
extends to the west of you.  The flickering shadows to the west lends
credence that there are more braziers.  The floor beneath your feet has been
carpeted by what looks to be reeds that were woven together.  The padding
offers stealth, but with the clanking of your equipment you may as well blow
a horn.

wall and wonder if it was meant to keep things out or in.  A small hole in
the wall looks to be some sort of keyhole.  If only you had the key...

lanterns send flickering shadows across the walls sending chills down your
spine.  Looking carefully at the stone shelf like structures, you are
horrified to see egg like larvae with humanoid figures inside.  A few stir
at the noise you make but otherwise seem blissfully asleep.  A cold breeze
from somewhere sends a shiver down your spine.  The chamber seems very much
like a necropolis.

looking demons and dark elves dancing upon the gory remains of dwarves and
surface elves.

The Nemuri Chamber~
Endless rows of stone shelves hold glass chambers with sleeping
soldiers.  A few pods are open and you see several distant shapes moving
about in the dark.  The glass tubes seem endless and seem to number in the
thousands.  If you're not careful you could end up walking about in circles.
