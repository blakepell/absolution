zebith~
Zebith~
Zebith stands here, protecting the city.
~
He stands proudly before you.  Even though he is short and slightly
stocky don't be fooled into thinking he isn't tough.  His eyes dart around,
looking for anyone that has tried to avoid justice.  Be very careful, it is
rumored that he was trained by an ancient troll shaman in ancient battle
techniques.

Here is Simple Simon the pieman.  The Simon's have been baking in this
city since it was first created ages ago.  Simple decided long ago to keep
up the family tradition.  His apron is covered with bits of dough, and from
head to toe you'd swear he was a ghost because of all the flour covering
him.

Jack~
Jack the tailor is here, hemming some pants.
~
You see him and his many legs (or arms?)  Stitching together two pieces
of cloth.  He has what looks like a hundred legs, and seems to have amazing
control over them.  That might explain how he managed to enter on Ruby Road,
as he immigrated here not so long ago.  You see him glace at you then
continue on with his work, that is so long as you are just browsing.

Narkon is one of the oldest Terrans that's living in Zebes.  He came from
the dwarven kingdom long ago, in the hopes of making his fortune, and

shoulders all the way down to her feet, and have bands of gold and silver
woven into it, complimenting her green eyes nicely.  Her hair is a curly

Garumn is looking around through the slits in his eyes.  While he has
been living here for many years now, he still isn't used to the outdoors, or
anything above-ground.  Anytime during the day, he always complains that it
is too bright.  None the less, he happens to be one of the finest swordsmen
around.

them to house their stores on their persons.  All of a sudden they spot you
and start walking over, better leave before they try and sell you something.

story~
It has been so long that no one can remember. The city of Zebes started as
nothing more than a trading post. As more and more ventured into the
wilderness of Dominia, its size slowly grew. Before long it was a busy town,
and then a city. This was its first golden age, but like all things it can't
last forever. Rumors started circulating of a great threat coming from the
east. The Dragons were coming... Preparations were made, and a keep was 
constructed in the south-western corner of the city. This was too little too
late, the keep was only nearing completion when the first scouts found the
city. There were only three of them, but the dragons managed to utterly 
decimate the city before being defeated. Most of the survivors flocked out
of the city leaving it to be a shell of its former self. Those that remained
finished the keep, and waited for the next wave. Stories soon started reaching
the city telling of the advancing front. Construction on the city walls was
started. But it was too late; word was spreading that the hordes would reach
the city before the completion. Something else would need to be done. Only 
nine mages remained in the city, they gathered to form a spell that could
protect the city. All nine, lead by Sli'vateer gathered in the village
square. The incantations were almost complete... then disaster struck. A
lone dragon attacked the city, and reached the mages. Just as the 
incantation was completing, a mage was slain by the dragon. The remaining
mages made quick work of the dragon, as the spell continued to form. Such a
disturbance could have easily destroyed the spell, but it remained, intact.
Celebration rang out, as the spell started to take hold, surrounding the city.
It first started its illusion in the village square, causing trees to rise
where a street once was. The illusion then started to spread outwards, causing
the city to look as if it was engulfed in a green blaze. In a matter of minutes
the gleaming city of Zebes had disappeared, becoming one with the forest it
was carved out of. Over time the spell has flickered and faded.... causing 
parts of the city to become exposed briefly. It is only a matter of time before
it fails altogether.

book~
The book is covered in years and years of dust, all of which is propelled
into the air as you open it with a big THUNK.  The text in the book looks
like a series of oddly shaped scribbles, making it very apparent it is
written in a language you can't understand.  You turn to the last page, and
the scribbles start to shift, forming letters, then words, that you can
read.  The passage reads as follows:
 
This room is what remains of the great mage Sil'vateer.  
He constructed it to project a spell over the entire city.
The spell's nature was to protect this city from harm,
lest Shandalar fall to the invading dragons.  This very
room is the outcome of that spell.  The columns that 
support the ceiling represent the elements of creation.
The glowing ball in the center is what unites everything.
The spell covers such a wide area, the matrix that supports
the spell must also be large. However, it is possible to
invoke a similar spell on oneself, by holding a 'sphere of
power'.  Its components for its matrix are the same as
this very room, only in much smaller quanities.

The most basic of codes was created by Fraqike.  His code took the
message he wished to send, broke it up into letters and made the first
letter of a series of words his code.  There have been many variations of
this basic in use over the centuries.  Most of them involving which place
the letter was inside the encooded message.  One of the more complex codes
that was used was the Zlahadeere code.  This process took a message, broke
it up into letters and then placed the first letter of the message as the
first letter of the first word, then the second letter would be the second
letter in the second word, and so on.  It used a simple process where the
key letter started at the first position, then was shifted to the second,
then the third and so on.  When the letter which was part of the message
landed on the end of a word, the process reset, with the message as the
first letter of the first word and so on.  There was even occasionally a
twist to further confuse codebreakers where the letters of the message were
reversed, so the code started with the last letter as the first letter of
the first word.  And one extreme instance have been recorded where pictures
were made from sequences of letters and each line counted as a single word.

Outside the North-West Gates~
You are standing outside the north-west gates of the city of Zebes.  The
breeze comes down from the north, gently blowing against your face making
you feel refreshed.  To the north, you see a small path leading away to a
distant land.  Perhaps it deserves a closer look.  To the east and south of
you, stand the large gates built ages ago to protect the city from invaders.
They used to be always closed, but recently they have been kept open during
this current peace.

Inside the North-West Gate~
Before you stands the largest set of gates you have ever seen.  They stand
well over fifty feet from the ground, dwarfing their surroundings.  You
imagine the beasts that were roaming in ancient times which caused these
massive gates to be built.  To the east of you is a manned guardhouse.  To
the north, past the gates, lies a field with paths leading away from the
city.  To the south lies Valdur Crescent.

Intersection of Valdur Crescent and River Road~
You are on the southern section of Valdur Crescent.  The western wall
runs north and south, and is on your west.  There is the odd bit of trash on
the ground, although none seems worth a closer look.  Valdur Crescent

On the Valdur Crescent Bridge~
You happen to be standing on a bridge which is part of Valdur Crescent. 
The sound of water rushing and gurgling comes from the floorboards below
you.  Those boards had better not break, you really don't think it would be
a pleasant way to take a swim.  Valdur Crescent continues to the north and
south.

Valdur Crescent~

Zebes' western wall, looking as tall and mighty as ever.  The road is fairly
ordinary and runs both north and south.  Towards the south you see some of

Inside the South-West Gate~
You are now at the south end of Valdur Crescent.  To the south of you lie
the biggest gates you have ever seen, well over fifty feet in height.  They
appear to be made of a kind of enchanted heavy steel, making them a
formidable blockade for anything trying to get through.  To the east of you
is a door, leading into a guardhouse.  Valdur Crescent starts towards the
north, leaving the gates and paths to other realms to the south.

Outside the South-West Gates~
You are now standing outside the south-west gates of the city of Zebes. 
The ground is fairly flat, with a couple paths leading off in various
directions.  There is the occasional small shrub growing between the grass. 
You can see off into the distance to the south and west, and wonder what
adventures there might be.  To the north and east you can see massive gates
protecting the city of Zebes.

shine brightly in the light, almost to the point where you are blinded.  To
the north you see a door which leads into a guardhouse.  You can also go
east on Drekmar Road, or through the gates into the wilderness.

Inside the North-West Gate~
Before you stands the largest gate you have ever seen.  It stands well
over fifty feet from the ground, dwarfing its surroundings.  It seems to be
made of heavy steel, but one that has been magically enhanced.  Good thing
they aren't needed today, imagine the beasts that were roaming for this
massive gate to be built.  To the south you see a manned guardhouse.  To the
west, past the gates, lies a field with paths leading away from the city. 
To the west lies Valdur Crescent.

the street here on the west, with the wall on the east.  On the ground where
the roadway meets the wall you notice a few small plants growing.  You look

glow dimly, providing light that the wall blocks out.  There are a few
scraps of garbage here on the street, although it seems fairly clean.  You
notice a heavily worn trough in the stone, probably from some kind of cart. 
You can go either north or south down Morentia Avenue, or west down a small

large murky moat.  You see some spots where the drawbridge would normally be
resting, but it happens to be up at the moment.  You consider trying your
luck swimming, but then you realize it might not be the smartest thing you

lies the Village Square, the very heart of Zebes.  To the south is the
Naboth River, which also doubles as a moat for the Keep.  Further to the
east is the markings of the drawbridge of the Keep, and beyond that the
eastern wall.  King's Street also continues to the west.

part of the Naboth River.  You can go to the south down Castle Road, or
either east or west down King's Street.

it.  The road continues to the north and south.  You look over the west side
of the bridge and think you could jump into the water.  It would be a nice

a ramp to the south, which seems to lead down into the Naboth River. 
Although, before that you should get a boat at the Marina to the north.  Or
you could keep your feet dry and stay on River Road, which continues to the

River Road~
You are walking by the River Naboth, on River Road.  The stories of the
gardens of this place certainly do not do it justice.  The beauty and
harmony with nature is unsurpassed by anything you have seen before.  River
Road continues to the east and west.  To the south lies the Old Mill.

River Road~
You are walking somewhere on River Road.  Birds are flying in the sky
above you, enjoying themselves.  Some land on the nearby trees for a rest,
while others land on the road to try and eat some leftovers from former
travelers.  Green plants grow abundantly here, being so close to the water's
edge.  Towards the south you can hear water, and see a bridge.  You can also
continue along River Road to the east or west.

On a Bridge~
You are on top of a bridge over the Naboth River.  A distinct gurgling
sound is coming from under the bridge, as the water churns around the
pillars.  To the north is River Road, and its wonderful gardens.  To the
south is King's Street, which eventually leads to the keep.

End of King's Street~
You are now at one end of King's Street.  There isn't much here, other
than some buildings.  The road bends here, with one way going to the north,
and the other to the east.  To the north you can hear the river Naboth
flowing under a bridge.  Towards the east is King's Street.

King's Street~
You are on King's Street, near the west end.  The road here is fairly
ordinary.  There are no shops, just a couple buildings on each side of the
road.  To the west is the end of King's Street, which appears to be a dead
end.  To the east is an intersection with Castle Road.

Arbur Alley~
You are in a narrow alleyway between the buildings, fondly called Arbur
Alley.  There isn't a lot of room here, just enough for a person, maybe two
side by side.  To the east you can see Morentia Avenue, and the eastern
wall.  The alleyway continues to the west.

Arbur Alley~
You are deep inside the darkness of Arbur Alley.  The buildings around
you block out the light making it very dark here.  You look to the east and
west and see nothing but darkness.  The sound of water trickling down a
building is all you hear.  To the north you think you see some light coming
from the space between the buildings.

Arbur Alley~
You are in a narrow alleyway between the buildings, fondly called Arbur
Alley.  It is a tight fit here; there is barely enough room for you to walk
properly.  You can see to the west is Cordenia, and to the east continues
the alley.

Cordenia South~
You are on Cordenia South, one of the main roads in the city of Zebes. 
The buildings here are fairly nice, and are probably not much older than
you.  To the east you see a small alleyway, leading off into the darkness. 
You can also continue either north or south down Cordenia.

Cordenia South~
You are near the southern end of Cordenia.  The street is empty and quiet
except for the occasional drip from a pipe.  The quiet sound is almost
frightening, you want to leave this place, it just seems unnatural.  You
look around and see that the road continues to the north and south.

Cordenia South And Kitchnur Street~
You are on the southern part of Cordenia, just a little south of the
Village Square.  The road here is narrower than it is to the north, although
wider than it is to the south.  There are some crowds here, but not enough
to make you feel uncomfortable.  You manage to catch a glimpse to the south
and see Cordenia continuing on.  To the west of you is the small street
Kitchnur.

Village Square~
You are now standing in the very heart of Zebes.  Here is the large town
square, where the townspeople gather for celebrations and of course
executions.  As you look around through the crowd on the west wall you see
the city gallows.  To the north and south lie Cordenia, one of the more
popular roads.  Off to the west is the hall of healers, where weary
travelers can refresh themselves from their long journeys.

Cordenia North and Maridion Street~
You are now on Cordenia North.  A little south of you lies the village
square for all of Zebes.  The road here is fairly wide, with a sidewalk
lining each side of the street.  Towards the east lies Maridion Street.  As
you look towards the north, further down Cordenia North, a glimmer of light
catches your eye.  Could there be something on the ground?

Corner of Cordenia North and Sterling Street~
You are nearing the end of Cordenia North.  The shadows being cast by the
surrounding buildings make it quite dark here.  The building to the east is
exceptionally large and has a large door leading onto the road.  As you look
westwards, towards Sterling Street, you can see the market.  Towards the
north the road narrows as it approaches Valdur Cresent.  To the south lies
more of Cordenia North.

Market Square~
Carts and people are busy all around you, moving, selling and buying
almost anything imaginable.  This is where most of the merchants from this
land gather to barter and trade.  The sound of animals, talking and of
course coins fills the air.  The market seems to continue in all directions,
through Sterling Street is to the east and west, and to the north, Ruby
Road.

Ruby Road~
You are on the southern portion of the famous Ruby Road, where the road
is actually paved with gold.  It was done several hundred years ago, to
celebrate the homecoming of one of the city's greatest citizens.  Your sense
of greed seems to be overcoming you as you are shown all the different
things you can purchase, so long as you have the gold for it.  To the west
comes the tantalizing smell of baked bread, and to the east lies the tailor
shop making garments fit for a king.  Northwards lies the market square, and
to the south you see a beautiful shop full of sparkling jewels.

The Jeweler's~
As you enter the store, a bright light shines into your eyes.  There are
sparkling gems and bits of gold everywhere.  The walls are covered by fine
tapestries and little glass display cases line the sides of the store.  This
seems to be one of the richer jewelers around, and Jubilee's prices reflect
that.

Sterling Street~
You are on Sterling Street, west of the Market Square.  There are
merchants and townsfolk hustling and bustling up and down the road.  There
are crates and barrels on the side of the road, some opened, some not.  As
you peer to the west you see Sterling Street continuing onwards.  Towards
the north is a tavern, The Lazy Elf.  To the south of you, screams and whips
can be heard from the slavery shop.

Sterling Street~
You are near the end of Sterling Street, where it merges with Valdur
Crescent, which lies to your west.  The street here has some people on it,
though not nearly as many as you hear coming from the east, further down
Sterling Street.  Towards the south you see a huge line-up of people.  They
all seem to be going into the bank, and are waiting calmly in line like
lambs at the slaughter.  You suppose you could join them, if you don't mind
waiting a good portion of your life.  Or, you could head off to the north,
towards the Pearl Casino.  The lights are flashing, and sounds of coins fill
the air.  Might be worth a quick look.

Ruby Road~
Carts and people are busy all around you, moving, selling and buying
almost anything imaginable.  This is where most of the merchants from this
land gather to barter and trade.  The sound of animals, talking and of
course coins fills the air.  There is a small sign here, maybe you should
read it.  The market continues to the north and south, while to the west is
Zebes' general store, and to the east lies the armoury.

Ruby Road~
The space here is very cramped, because of the hundreds of people jamming
the street.  Stalls cover both sides of the street and more have paired up
along the middle of the street.  There seem to be so many people here, that
there may not be enough stuff for you.  Better get buying!  As you try and
look around the crowds of people to the west you think you can make out a
tiny house with an open door.  Towards the east a large sign is hanging
showing the entrance to Garumn's Weapons.  Ruby Road continues to the north
and south.

seem to radiate a warmth that makes you just want to relax your tired eyes. 
The entire room is made of marble, yet the marble is warm to the touch. 
There looks like a nice spot over there on the floor where you could take a

On the Naboth River~

rushes around and under you, slowly pulling you with the current.  To the
north you can see a large ramp, which leads to the Marina.  Towards the east
you see an old dock, with an old mill right there on the river.  The river
flows down to the south and upstream to the west.

are white, from years of the sun bleaching them.  You can hear the sound of
water rushing by, powering the mill.  To the east are some large doors,
leading into the mill.  You can walk back on the land, by heading north to
River Road, or get your feet wet by going west onto the river.

You are at the intersection of Kitchnur Street and River Road.  There are
a few buildings here, but not nearly as many as towards the north.  It is
fairly green, and not just from the odd bit of slime but there is the
occasional tree or patch of grass.  River Road starts towards the west,
running parallel to the Naboth River.  There are several more trees and
plants in that direction.  You could also go north, where the greenery ends
and the core of the city begins.  A small building lies to the east, that
you could try entering as well.  Plants are growing all over the door, and
around it, how very odd.

road to the east or west.

that you could maybe squeeze into.  The road continues to the east and west.

There is some trash lining your feet, but you can't quite make out what it
might be, or was at some point long ago.  Finally you manage to get a
glimpse of the roads around you.  To the north lies Valdur Crescent, and to

of several of the great battles on Dominia, and are done with exquisite
detail.  As you look closer, it almost seems like the painting is moving,
and the battle is being acted out.  A loud sound makes you turn around, and
you are looking back east, the way you came in.

see to the west embedded in the wall is a large grate.  It was likely used
long ago to prevent attackers from entering the city through the river.  You
could stay here under the bridge like a troll, or you could go to the east
down the river.

In a Courtyard~
You are in what appears to be a forested courtyard.  The trees here are
very old, rising high into the air, blocking out most of the sky.  It is
very nice in here though, a little cool, but not enough to give you a chill.
The one thing that is nice is there is actually room here, unlike the narrow
passageway to the south.  Unfortunately that seems to be the only way out of
here.  Maybe you should relax here for a bit.

Inside the North-West Guardhouse~
You are now inside the North-West Guardhouse.  It is fairly large on the
inside here, with lanterns giving off just enough light to see.  You see an
empty bed on the floor, along with some half-eaten bits of food.  A small
spiral staircase leads up to a second floor of the tower.  There are doors
to the west and north, leading outside.

spiral staircase leads up to a second floor of the tower.  There are doors

Hall of the Gods~
You slowly walk into the hall, completely dumbfounded at the sheer size
of this place.  Slowly, you enter in the center of the hall, and can barely
see the walls along the sides.  You can't even see what is to the north, it
is just too far away.  Gigantic columns rise from the floor, shooting high
into the sky, towards the ceiling.  The floor below you glistens and
shimmers in the light.  A soft peaceful music fills the room, making you
relax.

Hall of the Gods~
You are now inside the dwelling of a god.  The walls are white and give
off a faint light.  Large columns reach from the marble floors up high to
the ceiling above you.  The ceiling is swirling and rippling as you stare at
it, as if it leads to another plane.  You can see the walls moving, forming
doors as you look about the room.  The sheer size and beauty of this place
gives you a feeling of awe, and makes you feel a little more humble.

Stryder's Chambers~
As you enter, the door seals up in behind you, leaving a seam-less wall. 
Looking around the chamber, it seems quite large, but still cozy.  A large
bed is in here, with a canopy overhanging covering it.  Against one wall a
fireplace roars away, giving everything a warm glow.  The entire room then
slowly fades away, making it seem you're on a beach, in a forest or wherever
your heart desires.  It all makes you feel happy and content, just watching
the scene play itself out.  Although you know you never leave, as you can
still see the fireplace where it should be, burning brightly.

canopy~
It stetches from the ceiling down to the floor, cloaking the bed
completely.  It glistens in the light, as you see that it isn't any fabric
you've ever seen.  It seems to flow as you look at it.  You finally realize
that it isn't cloth, but a stream of water, like a small waterfall
surrounding the bed.  As you touch it to move it out of the way, it parts
away from your hand, keeping you dry.  
~
E
bed~
It is fairly large, surely more than enough room for one person.  The
frame is a dark red wood, with intricate patters covering it.  The bedsheets
are fairly thin, but there appear to be many layers.  Pillows are at the
head of the bed, and again at the foot of the bed, providing a nice place to
sit and relax.  A large canopy draps overtop of the bed.

At the Edge of the forest~
You look around and see a magical forest.  While you have little idea
where this place came from, which is a little alarming, you manage to relax
and enjoy the view.  You can hear the sounds of wild animals off in the
distance.  Above you, circling, is Ariana, a rather large falcon.

Stryder's Shotgun Weddings~
The inside of the chapel is beautiful.  There are Christmas lights
strung from the walls and stapled onto the ceiling.  Some ribbons that have
now lost their luster now dangle from the walls.  The air is full of a thick
smoke, which was most likely caused by the organ player's constant smoking. 
The red carpet leading up to the 'altar' is in fairly good shape, with only
the occasional stain or broken bit of glass on it.  This looks like the
perfect place to get married!

Stryder's Den~
You are now inside Stryder's Den.  The walls are lined with books, many
of them dusty.  The floor is mahogany, matching the bookshelves.  There is a
rather imposing desk in the corner, which is in the process of creating its
own ecosystem.  And for some reason, which will never be explained, cubes
float high in the air, giving off a warm glow.

desk~
There is a fairly large and sturdy desk here.  It is made of a deep red
coloured wood, which goes very well with the room The desk is covered in
papers, ranging from "How to take over the World" to "Mom's Chocolate Cookie
Recipe."  There is a small skull shaped paperweight on some of the papers,
keeping them from blowing away.  In one corner of the desk is a small
computer, churning its CPU away at some problem (and having some problems
with it too).  There are some drawers in the desk, but you really don't have
the need or inkling to see what they contain.

On the North Wall~
You are on the Northern Wall of Zebes.  This is the city's defense
against the outside world.  On many historic occasions these walls have
protected the city and its citizens.  They seem to still be in great shape,
especially given their age.  You can see the lands of Dominia to the north. 
To the east and west continues the path of the North Wall.  There is a door
leading into the Turret to the south.

On the West Wall~
You are on the Western Wall of the city.  The wind howls by you, almost
blowing you over.  In the wind is carried the odd leaf, blown from the
forests to the west.  You try and find shelter behind the crenels, although
they do very little.  You could try moving either north or south where the
wind isn't as fierce, or go into the turret to the east.

You are now on the upper floor of the turret.  The floor is old and worn,
but seems fairly sturdy.  You can see some stairs leading down, to the
ground level.  Stone walls completely enclose the room, making it rather
claustrophobic.  There are however two breaks in it, one to the north, and
the other to the east where doors lead out of this room.

occasional spot some moss or lichen grows, adding some colour to the
otherwise grey surroundings.  The wall continues to the east and west.  A
door lies to the south, leading into the turret.

here.  As you look between the crenels to the south of you, the countryside
shows itself, and continues for miles on end.  To the north is the city; you
can even make out some people down below you, although they look about the
size of ants.  You can continue along the wall to the west or east.

You are now on part of the South Wall of Zebes.  The stone of the wall is
cold to the touch, and hasn't moved in hundreds of years of being here.  All
that time has taken a bit of a toll on it though; there are now some signs
of wear.  The floor is polished, and some of the limestone has seeped out of
the wall.  This limestone reformed, as it trickled down the walls, into
columns that resemble stalactites which are embedded into the wall.  To the
south you feel a gentle breeze blowing on your face, as you overlook part of
Dominia.  The wall continues to the east and west.

River flowing towards the front of the Keep.  You can head back to the west,

is smooth from years of wear.  The wall looks fairly thick from this
perspective, at least ten cubits deep.  Peeking between the crenels of the
wall, to the east, lie the lands of Dominia, spanning on for miles on end. 
Such a view just inspires you, as if new life was being breathed into your
soul.  To the west is the city, with all of its tiny people scurrying about,
between the buildings.  You can continue along the wall to the north or
south.

You are now on part of the East Wall of Zebes.  As you continue walking,
your hand brushes up against the wall, which gently cools your hand.  The
wall feels very smooth for stone, probably due to the years of wear.  You
can see the occasional white streak running down the wall, the result of
minerals running out of the stone.  A gentle breeze blows from the east, as
you overlook part of Dominia.  The wall continues north and south.

explored.  To the west, far down below, you can see the moat going around
the Keep.  You can also go back up to the north, up the East Wall.

ideal for pouring boiling oil and water on potential invaders of the city.

past your waist to the north, stopping you from falling off.  You can

On the West Wall~
You are walking on the West Wall of Zebes.  The wall is made of large
stones, and has a very smooth path on it, from years of patrols passing
here.  As you look between the crenels to the west of you, the countryside
shows itself, and continues for miles on end.  To the east is the city; you
can even make out some people down below you, although they look about the
size of ants.  You can continue along the wall to the north or south.

You are walking on the West Wall.  You look over one side of the wall to
the east and see the city of Zebes, with its mazes of streets and alleys. 
Over to the west you can see some forests and plains, scattered about
Dominia.  The wall continues to the north and south.

On the West Wall~
You are now on part of the West Wall of Zebes.  The stone of the wall is
cold to the touch, and hasn't moved in hundreds of years of being here.  All
that time has taken a bit of a toll on it though; there are now some signs
of wear.  The floor is polished, and some of the limestone has seeped out of
the wall.  This limestone reformed, as it trickled down the walls, into
columns that resemble stalactites which are embedded into the wall.  To the
west you feel a gentle breeze blowing on your face, as you overlook part of
Dominia.  The wall continues to the north and south.

Above the South-West Entrance~
You are at the corner where the south and west walls meet.  You step up
onto the raised floor here, which gives you a better view of your
surroundings.  You can see the tops of many of the buildings in the city. 
To the far east you can see the Keep of the city, towering over everything. 
There are some small holes in the platform, which lead down to the gate,
making it possible for the guards to attack invaders from above.  You can
continue along the west wall to the north, or the south wall to the east.

On the Moat~
You are now on the moat, before the Keep.  The water here has a nice
healthy green hue to it, are you really sure you want to be swimming here? 
The Keep is just to the south of you, and its steep walls make it impossible
for you to climb out on that side of the moat.  Luckily, to the north you
think you can make it up the steep bank onto the roadway.  This thing called
a moat continues on to the east, or leads to fresher waters to the west.

On the Moat~
You're on the moat before the Zebian Keep.  It is there to the south of
you, reaching high into the sky.  You can see where the drawbridge meets
with the ground to the north, and the reinforcing that has occurred has made
the river bank impossible to climb up.  You guess you could sit here for a
bit, or continue on the moat to the east or west.

On the Moat~
The murky green water of the moat slowly swirls as you pass by it.  Heat
slowly radiates off the stone from the Keep, warming you and the water.  The
bank to the north looks rather steep but climbable.  You can also float to
the east or west.

You are at the end of the Moat.  The water slowly trickles out of the
gate for the river to the east.  You can see the Keep to the south of you,
attaching to the east wall of the city.  To the north you can't see much,
but you think there might be something neat past the bank.  Then of course,
you could laze around here for a bit longer.

In a tree~
As you make it to the top of the tree, you find a little branch that you
can stand on.  You make the mistake of looking down...  Always a mistake,
and almost lose your balance.  The canopy of leaves is still above your
head, protecting you somewhat from the elements.  You take in a deep breath
of fresh air, and relax.  Gazing around you happen to see small flowers
growing out of the tree.  One of them seems to be closed, wonder what is
inside.

Inside an old building~
As you enter the building a cobweb hits you in the face.  It looks like
this place hasn't seen the light of day in ages.  The air seems stale, or it
could be all the dust you are inhaling.  On the floor there seems to be some
junk, but it is hard to tell beneath the cobwebs and dust.

An alchemist's hidden lair~
Through the floating dust you can make out the basic outline of the room.
There appears to be some bookcases lining the walls, but the cobwebs
covering them are so think you can't make out the titles.  There are seven
large pillars embedded into the walls, circling the room.  Each seems to be
made of a different substance.  The floor, even though there are layers of
dust on it still shimmers brightly.  A large table resides off to a corner
of the room.  Something about this place just doesn't look quite right.  Who
would leave all of this without any defense?

columns~
As you look closer you can see each column goes from the floor up to the
ceiling, and arches towards this glowing ball in the middle of the room. 
You look at one of them and can see the grain of what appears to be wood. 
It is brownish-red in colour, and has a nice glossy finish.  The next column
looks as if it really isn't there.  You can make out an outline, but that is
about it.  As you reach you hand to touch it, it passes through it and you
feel a slight breeze on your hand.  Walking over to the next column you see
it is a dull green colour.  The closer you get towards it the hotter and
more feverish you feel.  You had better stay away from that one.  The next
column looks like it was once metal, but is now all rusted and decayed. 
Moving over to the next one, it looks like a little waterfall.  You can hear
the rushing of water as it travels up from the floor towards the ceiling. 
Approaching the next you put your hand infront of your eyes to stop the
glare.  Light just pours from this column illuminating a good deal of the
area around it.  The last column is covered in...  Well everything!  Plants
are growing from it, insects are crawling on it, it looks quite alive.  You
wonder curiously why this room is so strangely constructed.

Along both sides of the path are a continuing line of stones.  The lack of
growth on the path indicates that the forest is allowed to grow freely so
long as the path remains clear.  The lines of stones and the path continue

say to stick around after that, but I remember seeing, through the dust, an almost magical room below. Although all these years of have dulled my memory. Wait! I have an idea, go tell my friend Oldarin
say that "Malgoar was wondering if you remember where that old house is, the one with the bad floor." I am sure he knows. Anyways, I must be off. I have many mode adventures to go on.
