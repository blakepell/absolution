Ability Scores
Strength determines how much weight you can carry, increases your chance
of hitting slightly, and gives a large boost to your damage.
 
Dexterity determines how many items you can carry, increases your armor
class, and the success of many combat skills.
 
Constitution determines how many hit points you get when you level up,
and reduces the damage you take from magic.
 
Intelligence determines how fast your skills improve, and the success
of many spells.
 
Wisdom determines how many practices you get when you level up, and the
damage of many spells.
 
Make sure that you maximize your Con, Int, and Wis when you are about to
level, and maximize your Str and Dex when fighting.
~
E
page2~
Secondary Stats
 
Armor class shields you from physical attacks by causing them to miss.
 
Hitroll defines your chance of hitting or missing your foes. Spells
and equipment can increase it.
 
Damage roll increases the damage you do with your physical attacks,
but not on a one to one ratio.
 
Saving throws lower the success of enemy magic. The lower your saving
throws, the better.
 
Age can affect the experience you recieve if you are a race other than
human. You need 2x the hours of your current level to recieve full exp.
Use gear or just time spent on Redemption to nullify any penalty.
 
Alignment reflects what direction your character is going. If you
kill good mobs, your character will go more evil. If you kill evil
mobs, your character will become more good. This can affect some reclasses.
In addition, if you kill a mob of your same alignment, you will get less
experience than if you had killed one of the opposite alignment.
~

page3~
Character Setup
 
One thing you should do, is set up your prompt. This is a good start:
{C{Cprompt <%hhp %mm %vmv %Xtnl %ggp %ssp>{x{x
Feel free to color code each one or add new parts. For more help type
{RHelp Prompt{x and for color help type {RHelp Color.{x
 
To turn on Color Mode, simply type {RColor.{x
 
Also set your wimpy. Wimpy allows your character to auto flee if his
HP reaches the set amount. This is very useful in both leveling and
Player Killing (PK). To turn on wimpy type {RWimpy{x. Wimpy can also be
set to different amounts (up to 50% your current max hp). It is a
good idea to reset your wimpy whenever you acheive a new level.

Training and Practicing In order to train or practice, you must first
find a Trainer.  Within the Academy, you can find a Trainer at the Entrance
as well as in the Guilds.  In Midgaard, the directions to the Temple of

General Information
 
More of your character information will become available as you level up
to level 25. Also at level 25 you will gain a new equipment slot called
"Orbit" which allows you to wear a second "Float" item.
 
When you die to a player or a mob, you cannot attack anything for 3
minutes. Players also cannot attack you for that same stretch, but
aggie mobs will still attack.

Combat Commands
 
Kill <Target> - Begins combat with your intended foe.
Flee - Allows you to flee from combat. May not work the first time.
Consider <Target> - Allows you to see how tough your opponent is compaired
to your level.
 
The skills Dodge, Parry, and Shield Block are important to have if you
plan to engage in melee combat. These skills help you avoid blows from
your foes.
 
Bash and Trip are similar skills for stopping your foes from fleeing,
however they work best against different targets, so it can be useful to
have both. Dirt kick is handy for blinding your foes, and Disarm deprives
your target from their weapon. Also make sure you have as many attacks as
you can through skills and the haste spell.
 
Other skills such as Kick and Backstab can also help weaken your foes.

The Sorting Room~
The walls, floor, and ceiling of this room are crafted from a dark grey
stone.  The room is lit by a single glowing torch that doesn't give off any
heat.  In the world of Redemption, there are two classifications of
citizens: Clanners and Non-Clanners.  Those who belong to clanner caste can
join one of four clans and fight battles against other players. 
Non-clanners can join one of many guilds, and cannot be harmed nor cause
harm to other players.  The four clans of Redemption are: {RSeeker,
Kindred, Kenshi{x, and {RVenari{x.  For more information on each of the
clans, type help <clan>.  There are many guilds for non-clanners, each with
their own help file.  You cannot join a clan or guild till you reach level
10.  Move on to the next room once you have finished learning about the
clanner system.

Combat Training~
The walls, floor, and ceiling of this room are crafted from a dark grey
stone.  The room is lit by a single glowing torch that doesn't give off any
heat.  In this section you will learn about combat.  The combat dummy in
this room is a normal mob.  He isn't particularly wimpy nor aggressive.  Go
ahead and kill him by typing {RKill dummy{x.  Once you have finished your
combat, you will see that you were awarded experience, money, and maybe even
some deity points.  Depending on the respective level of the mob compared to
yours, will define how much experience you'll receive for defeating it. 
Once it is dead, go north and face the wimpy dummy which may try to flee. 
Follow it, and kill it.  Once you are done go all south and face the
aggressive dummy.  He should automatically attack you.  Be wary of
aggressive mobs in the world of Redemption.  If you want to find out if a
mob is too tough for you, use {Rconsider <name>{x If the fight is to tough,
feel free to {Rflee{x from the combat.  Also remember that you can {Rpeer{x
into a room to see what's in it before you even enter.  Once you have
completed all 3 combats, move on to the east.

Entrance to the Obstacle Course~
The walls, floor, and ceiling of this room are crafted from a dark grey
stone.  The room is lit by a single glowing torch that doesn't give off any
heat.  Now it's time for you to learn about terrain.  As you traverse
through the continents of Terra and Dominia, you will find yourself going
through forests, roads, mountains, even rivers.  Each terrain can affect you
differently (mainly in how tired you become) and some you can't even go
through without proper spells or equipment (such as deep water).  In the
next several rooms, you will go through each type of terrain and see its
affects on you.  Make sure you pick up the {Rraft{x before you go as you
will need it to complete the course.

foes.  Trains are well spent on hit points, mana, and wisdom.  Clerics can
walk two paths on reclass: The path of evil, Heretic, or the path of good,
Exorcist.

The Monk's Training Hall~
The guildhalls are less fancy than the previous halls.  The walls are no
longer covered in marble, but rather in cold grey stone.  The room is lit by
several torches on the wall.  Monks are unarmed specialists that excel in
battle.  Concentrate on dealing a lot of damage quickly and make good use of
your abilities to hit your foes vulnerable spots.  Trains are best spent in
hit points, although using a few on dexterity or strength can be useful. 
Monks can reclass into Ninjas or Samurai.

The End of the Tutorial!~
It's the end of of the tutorial!  If you think you need more practice or
are missing any slots in your newbie gear, you may want to go back and find
the pieces.  However, if you are ready, go ahead and descend the ladder
down.  If you want to try player killing out, open the door to the north and
enter the Arena.  You and other players (of level 5 or less) can attack each
other and die without penalty.  If you wish to explore the rest of Terra,
just walk to the south and you will be at recall in Midgaard.

Fort Bosco~
This fort was built to run training exercises to replicate an authentic
attack on a fort of Bosco.  It is your mission as a cadet to defend the fort
against the attacking Dominian forces.  Go out and defeat the Commander of
each attacking army.  They hold an item you may find useful in later levels.
If you are up for a challenge, travel into the cellar of the fort and face a
legendary beast.  Be warned that you must do this before you reach level 6. 
When you are ready to leave the fort, go back up and then south.

Before the Lair of the Legendary Beast~
You are in a dark tunnel under the fort.  The cave walls are covered in
transparent slime and the floor is littered in bones.  You hear a sucking
sound to the north, almost as if a creature is sucking the soul out of
something.  If you think you are ready to tackle it, then head north and try
to defeat it.  Make sure you are wearing full gear and have spells on when
you combat it.  If it proves too tough, then try to rally some teammates to
help you defeat it.

from the old arena, and he has grown to a massive size.  He will be
difficult to kill by yourself.  However, the reward may be worth the risk.

Path to the {rBlood{wHive{x Camp~
The path has slimmed to only a few feet wide.  You hear the sound of
smiths sharpening blades and warriors preparing for battle.  The path begins
to descend into the earth, and the tunnel grows dark.  There is an eerie
silence in the air that is quite unsettling.  The tunnel continues to the
south and the battlefield lies to the north.

Ravenfeather's Sanctuary~
Anderyn's office is a fairly nice room.  It is decorated in a very
business like manor.  An old sturdy desk and an old coke machine sit in the
room looking perfectly normal.  Some lovely tapestries line the walls and a
comfy couch sits next to a wall.  There are no visable exits.
