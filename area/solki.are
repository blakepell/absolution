small furry creature~
the elevator guard~
A small furry creature stands here at the bottom of the tree.
~
There is a small furry creature standing here on its hind legs. It is
dressed in various hides, and seems to be intelligent. It looks over at
you, and nods at you. He looks like he is guarding something of some sort,
though you can see nothing of value around. Perhaps there is something in
the tree behind him which is of value?

a deer~
A deer is quietly grazing in the woods.
~
You see a single deer slowly drinking from a tiny creek. It seems to be
spooked by almost every noise which doesn't seem natural. It looks up,
and moves a short distance to a fresh part of the stream. The power in its
legs simply amazes you. It seems so docile, and so beautiful. The white
markings on its shiny coat seem to catch the sun occasionally.

to other squirrels in the area, and they occasionally respond. You notice 
as it sees a single nut lying on the ground. It stuffs it into its mouth
and bounds off for some secret hiding spot.

or eluding prey.

This healer is here to help you get ready for battle. He is fairly well
trained in the clerical arts, though no doubt not quite as well as others
you have encountered in your travels. He'll help you be the best you

A large, burly, hairy fellow is standing here.  Beneath his bushy,
drooping eyebrows, you can see his eyes are warily surveying the land
around, to ensure nothing amiss is happening.  His stance implies that he
knows very well how to use the weapon at his side as well as how to fight
bare-handed when necessary.

you the salad of your choice.  She has long, brown hair, and is quite
slender.  Perhaps eating salads all day long helps her keep in shape.  She
is wearing an apron with pictures of a few vegetables on them.  Her friendly

A large, moustached Solki is reading up on the latest armor.
~
A very large Solki is standing here.  He wears a large brown mustache on
his face, and less hair on the top of his head than most other Solki have. 
He has tattoos of swords, shields, and snakes on his forearms and chest,
which have coloured the hair which grow from those places, so that his fur
looks tattooed as well as his body.  The quickness with which he does his
job is more than you would expect from someone his size.

He seems to glance around occasionally, as if confirming his surroundings. 
He is in rather good shape, although still seems tired from his recent
exercise.  He looks as though he will one day make a fine member of the
Solki military.

An old man is here, examining a blade.
~
You see an old man, seemingly leaning against the wall for support as he
checks the edge on a perfectly sharp dagger.  He looks at you, and you feel
as if he has judged your ability to run, fight, and dodge, all in a single
glance.  As you look at him more closely, you realise that underneath his
fur are well toned muscles that have never forgotten their exertions from
years past.  He has several scars along his arms, although you feel that his
opponent likely left the fight in a much worse situation, if he left at all.

Martin the magic man~
A short Solki wearing a white coat is ready to sell you an artifact.
~
A short, skinny Solki is busy scurrying around his shop.  He steps over
to one shelf and picks up a jaundice coloured wand.  He turns it over,
shakes it a bit, and then replaces it with a self-satisfied nod.  As he
turns around, he notices you watching him.  He makes a small squeek and
turns back towards the main counter.  His extremely small steps manage to
take him surprisingly quickly back to where his books lie.  Once there, he
regards you more calmly, and inquires as to what service he can provide for
you.

the room.  Each of his fingers sports a ring with a jewel of unimaginable
size.  As he notices you studying him, he smiles haughtily at you, and you
can see that over half his teeth have been replaced with gold.  A large
bejeweled dagger is sheathed at his belt, but you don't doubt that the blade
is sharp enough to easily break through your skin.

height, moderately good looking, and an easy going manner manage to make
this Solki one of the least interesting and most boring Solki you have ever
seen.

the drill sergeant~
The drill sergeant is standing here, inspiring fear in all his cadets.
~
You cannot help but notice the drill sergeant standing here; his frequent
loud and piercing bellows are impossible to ignore.  He seems to currently
be berating some poor cadet for failing to button up the buttons on his
tunic in the correct order.  He is very large for a Solki, and seems to be
extremely skilled at a wide variety of martial arts.

the General~
The General is slowly pacing back and forth, debating his next command.
~
A very large and very hairy Solki stands before you.  Despite his age,
you can tell that he has kept in the very best of physical shape.  Even
while at ease, there is a tension with him, as if he is always ready to
fight.  His knowledge of both personal combat and group tactics would make
him a worthy adversary.

A well-trained military man is here, ready to do his duty.
~
A career officer stands tall before you.  He is everything a military man
should be; strong, quick and decisive in his actions.  With a single glance,
he has accurately gauged your current combat ability as well as your
potential.  His broad shoulders and powerful jaw are quite intimidating, and
make you think twice about crossing him.

The Forest Floor~
You crunch a few leaves into the dust as you walk through here. Tall
trees tower around you on either side, and there seems to be no clear
path; you can merely wander wherever there is a gap in the trees large
enough for you. Squirrels chatter in the distance, and the wind
gently ruffles your hair.

seems a bit brighter. A small animal of some sort darts across your

A few bugs buzz by you, but you are definitely used to such pests by
now. The leaves rustle a bit in the wind, and a few branches creak, and
you try to gauge whether or not a storm will be coming soon or not.
Deciding it is relatively safe, you decide to continue your explorations,
which look like they would be most fruitful to the west or north.

The trees are a bit closer together here, and land is slightly uneven to
the west, making it a little harder to climb there. A few bushes are dotted
here and there, filled with berries which you could swear you aren't
supposed to eat, if you want to stay healthy.

You see a tree off to one side which you think might bear some fruit. 
After approaching it, you realise the fruit is most likely poisonous, and
that it simply isn't worth the risk.  You continue to wander onwards,
picking a random direction through the trees.  One direction looks just as
good as any other at the moment.

You see just a quick second of a deer running through the trees at a
distance. A few birds overhead sing a sweet melody. The entire forest
seems to be rather at peace, as though it has been marred by human
hands, but has been left to grow on its own.

The songs of a few birds seem to be coming from somewhere above you.  As
you try to pinpoint the location, you notice a few squirrels leaping from
tree to tree in the search for food for the next winter.  Unable to find the
birds, you look back down, and are rewarded by the sight of a deer, bounding
along in the distance at full speed.

a split trunk and are growing in different directions, and one tree
which seems to only be alive on one half.

wind rustles the leaves, and you decide it's time to move on. The
ground seems a little uneven here, but walking is still not terribly
difficult, although it would be easier if there were a set path.

few other bushes around you, with berries on them. You sample a couple which
seem non-poisonous. While they test fairly good, they aren't filling at all.

you've ever seen, though they are spaced enough apart to let light shine
through. The light is just enough to let some flowers and bushes grow.

As you walk underneath a low-hanging branch, you reach up and pick off a
single leaf. You fidget with it for a moment, before letting it drift slowly
down to the ground. A butterfly flutters by to land on a branch not
too far away. You try to get closer, but it keeps flying away. Eventually,
you simply gaze at its beauty from a distance.

rich smell of the forest. You lean back against a tree trunk for a while,
just taking it all in.

you should head east or south back towards the rest of the forest.

around, and there seems to be a large furry one standing right in front
of the tree. There seem to be a few ropes attached to the tree around
a pulley, which ascend up towards the higher branches. Looking up,
you can almost see a few platforms suspended somewhere above your head.

great mount of skill. You can see how the various planks of wood seemed to
be almost grown together: You can see no obvious means of how this room was
assembled. The leaf roof above you lets just enough sunlight through to see
by, yet you have no doubt it would keep out any inclement weather.

platform, there seem to be a few buildings. There is a small pathway to the
north, and another path seems to go east-west from there, with more buildings
around them. You seem to have found an entire city up here in the trees.

On the Rope Bridge~
You are standing on a long rope bridge spanning between two sections
of this village. The bridge sways a little as you walk over it, but feels
sturdy enough for you not to be afraid. Looking over the edge may not be
a good idea if you're afraid of heights, as you are very high off the ground.

You turn around, and are glad to see that you're not currently on
that rope bridge, which is dangling between the trees, haphazardly. Before
you, you see the hustle and bustle of a great city, with merchants from
all the surrounding lands gathered here to sell their wares. You also see
many people wandering the streets, trying to figure out where they can
get the best buy.

stand, you see a variety of javelins.  A single window somehow illuminates
the entire room.  There is one desk by the rear of the room, behind which
sits an old man with a long beard, who is checking the edge on a dagger.  He
looks up at you, sees that you seem to know something about weapons, and
prepares to tell you a tale about whichever weapon it is you seek.

road is fairly wide, and sparsely decorated.  There are only adults in this
part of the road, walking to their various jobs.  Towards the west you can
smell the alluring scent of freshly brewed alcohol.  There is a sign above a
door to the east is a sign which simply says 'Usr Tequyko'.

The Main Road~
You are walking on the large main road of this city as it travels through
the industrial section of town.  You can see a lot of business people
wandering about their business, either talking to create new connections or
moving to their place of work.  To the east of you is a large, bulky
building, and to the west of you is a somewhat smaller building in a state
of obvious disrepair.

There is a very large building sitting to the east of you, with windows set
very high towards the ceiling.  The road seems to be well travelled and
often used by many of the businessfolk of this town.  To the north is a
large open square.

This is a very wide open area where the main street of the town bends
from heading east-west to heading north-south.  This is the main square for
the production center of the city.  You see large packages being moved from
one building to another and people moving quickly from one location to
another.  A lot of the movement seems to center around a large company
headquarters, located to the northeast of you.

the road you are on is carrying a lot of traffic both to and from that area.
The road is kept in very good condition, and it seems to be completely
smooth.  There is a large rectangular building to the north of you and a
smaller, more uniquely designed building to the south, with a sign on the
door that reads 'Zenaqew Fyuuwadn Xwedu'.

seems to take place.  There is a large building to the north of you, and a
smaller one to the south.  The one to the south has a sign over the door

prevent the grass from growing.  To the west, a smallish hut sits on a path
which leads into the forest.  The fields extend in all other directions.
