Outside the Jungle~
You are at the edge of the jungle.  It is densely overgrown with moss and
vines.  There is a rotten stump in the middle of a mud puddle, bubbles
oozing from every sunken crack.  A small iron sign is in the mud in front of
the stump.  To the north is a cleared dirt path and to the west is what
remains of someone's swamp boat.  The boat looks like it was torn to pieces
by some hideous beast.

| Those who chose to procede, do so without my permission. |
|           Few who venture forth return alive.            |

End of the Stump~
You are just outside the stump.  The ground beneath you is litterally
made of corpses.  They look as though they've been whipped, beaten, and cut
until they died from pain.  Above you, the faintest trace of light from
either sun, moon, or stars can barely be detected.  A piece of wood wrapped
in oily cloth burns on the wall beside you.  An odd green glow emanates from
the north and east.  The walls seem to be made of solid stone.  It's cold to
the touch and very smooth.

A Guard Post~
You are in a crossway.  The room itself is rounded on all sides.  There
are tiny holes in the ceiling where water drips through.  Small streams of
blood soak through the walls, mixing with the water and forming pools on the
floor.  Exits lead in all cardinal directions.

The West Hall Training Room~
You are in the west hall training room.  This looks like the room where
the talons are trained.  A few mangled dummies lie in a crumpled pile in the
center of the room.  Their necks and torsos have been ripped to pieces. 
Dummie fluff fills the air, giving the impression that this room is used
quite often and that the talons of these halls aren't to be messed with. 
The interrogation room is to the south.  To the north, another hallway
crosses this one.

The South Hall Training Room~
You are in the south hall training room.  A few mangled dummies stand in
the center of the room.  It seems that this is where the guards train.  The
limbs of dummies are scattered throughout the room.  Dummie fluff fills the
air, leading to the conclusion that this room is used frequently and that
the guards of these halls are very well trained.  The interrogation room is
to the west.  To the east, another hallway crosses this one.

frozen, shattered, melting, and glowing dummies stand in the center of the
room.  The raw energy expelled here can be easily felt in the room.  Dummie
fluff fills the air, though it isn't apparent where it all comes from.  The
alchemy chamber is to the east.  To the west, another hallway crosses this
one.

The East Hall Training Room~
You are in the east hall training room.  A few perfectly formed dummies
stand in the middle of the room.  Some of them are even moving about on
their own.  It is completely unclear as to what this room is used for. 
Dummie fluff fills the air, even when there are no dismembered or shredded
dummies anywhere in the room.  The alchemy room is to the north.  To the
south, another hallway crosses this one.

The Interrogation Room~
You are in the interrogation room.  A bright light shines down from the
ceiling onto a large table.  The table itself has leather straps on the
corners for holding a prisoner in place.  A small shelf, hanging on the side
of the table, holds placers for a series of odd shaped scalpels, hooks, and
clamps.  Below the table, a small drain allows blood to flow from the room. 
Training rooms lie to the north and east.

the floor heats some huge cauldrons directly above.  The walls are lined
with shelves, each holding many bottles of different shapes, sizes, and
materials.  An entrancing smell flows through the air in this room. 
Training rooms lie to the south and west.

tables for accupuncture, paintings of geometrically impossible shapes, and
hanging incense sticks, all of masterful craftmanship, allow you to prepare
for your judgement.  The trials commence to the north.  To the south,

You are in the trial of strength.  The spiked walls gradually close
inward, crushing anything between.  A control for the gears is clicking away
on the far wall.  The only way to get out alive is to trigger the control
before the walls close in.  The trial of wisdom is to the east.  The

must go through the fire in order to flip the switch and stop the floor on
both sides of the pit from falling away.  The abyss is to the east.  The
