sword~
This rune blade was wielded by Commander Ramon, but he only understands
the basics of its use.  He is using it as a crude slashing weapon without
any understanding of its function.  Empowered with the correct gems, this
runed blade could become a powerful "humming voidblade" with terrible energy
draining properties.  Naturally, the construction of such a blade is
exceptionally difficult, and requires 4 Gems of False Prophecy which must be
bound into the blade in pairs, using the power of a vaccuum.

The Living Room~
You find yourself standing on a carpet of dark green moss so soft that it
squishes between your toes.  You blink your eyes in amazement as you realize
that you're in someone's secret treehouse, perched in the uppermost fork of
an ancient banyan tree.  Green vines hang down all around you, and you hear
the chitter of animals below you and the cacophony of birds in the distance.
As the sunlight filters hazily down through the canopy, you catch a glimpse
through a gap in the branches, of the rainforest that surrounds you, and you
feel a sense of tranquility steal upon you and you wish you never had to
leave.

The Entrance to Grimstone Keep~
Though still under a great deal of construction and cluttered with
materials and tools, the room is awe-inspiring by its sheer size - even
considering that it is being built for a giant.  Though it is not complete,
the room has the feel of existing for a purpose, not simply for appearances.
To the west is a barred door, and to the east a set of huge bronze doors
lead to the yet unfinished dining hall.  Two massive staircases curve up
either side of the foyer to unfinished rooms on the second level, and a door
between them leads to the manor lord's study.

You have happened upon Chikara's private sanctum, his respite from the
world.  Before you lies a meticulously well-tended garden with a high
hedgerow surrounding it and paths of white crushed stone leading to and
around a shallow pool in the middle.  In the middle of the pool is a large,
rather horrifying statue - it depicts an unidentifiable, screaming figure,
on its knees chained hand and foot to a post in the earth, being tortured
and run through by angels with spears.  The plaque reads, "The time of
judgement draws near."  Through the water in the pool, you strain to see a
door of some kind.

is donning a black suit of armor, lined with gold, white light reflecting of

silver katana is seen, with a chain hanging from the handle, crafted by an
artisan in Shandalar.

You're standing in a small shack with a few shelves holding items for sale. 
The shopkeeper stands behind a small counter smiling at you, he points at a 
sign which has the prices, and begins cleaning up the small area of work space
which he has.  On the north wall are potions of all sorts, and the east wall 
has food, and pills, and stuff.  The south wall holds other items of interest, 
such as wands and staffs.  The shopkeeper turns back to you and smiles once

Within the Castle Walls~
Here and there lie pieces of armor set out of the way, and shields with short
swords with them hang on the walls.  There's a small bustle in the middle of
the room where there lies a couch, and a fountain, mysteriously spouting some
lemonade.  From the door to the couch is a velvet red carpet, and on the walls
are murals depicting the battles and hero's of the past. The couch
looks nice and comfy, a wonderful place to sit.

{GGuest Hall{x~
You seem to have entered the mansion's grand hall.  It is here where the
Lord And Duke entertain their guests.  The room is quite large, all the
walls are painted in white, and huge windows surround the place, giving the
room a lot of light.  The room is furnished with luxury sofas, made of silk
and velvet, and an oak tree table, also quite expensive.  Protraits of the
owners' ancestors hang on the walls, as well as paintings made by famous
artists.  There is a warm fireplace in the back of the room, the fireplace
is working on pure magic, so no logs are needed.  A large persian carpet is
on the floor, decorated with beautful drawings.  The servants and maids of
the mansion are here to fulfill your every wise and command, and to make
sure you are never hungry or thirsty.  Indeed, it seems to be a lovely
dream-house.

As you stand between the massive statues of the Avide sisters on either

your body becomes fearfully lifeless; as you slump into the silken sheets,
you swear to yourself that the statues are cackling at your demise...  More

{yShadow of the Old Oak{x~
The Old Oak.  Higher then the tallest tower in all of Stoneridge,
reaching, it seems, to the very clouds themselves - no, to the very heavens!
It's trunk older then dirt, harder then concrete.  Much of it is bare, only
the upper half having thick, spreading boughs and branches to lend their
cooling shade.  The trunk itself does that duty; the majority of the field
is permanently darkened due to the massive, stalwart Tree.  Thick roots are
occasionally visible near the hilly base of the tree, gnarled and worn from
age yet still strong, some as thick as a wagon.  The very life of the land
itself seems to hum beneath its roots, tapping into the soul of the earth. 
Grey, though, are some aspects of the lower portions of the Oak- some
sections seem dead and lifeless, where many are a spritely brown and green. 
Time waits for noone, human or plant.  Small rooms are set into the Oak's
trunk.

{yLair of the Mirkwood King{x~
It's almost impossible to pick one's path through this chamber in the oak
tree - it's completely full of old items and belongings from an age gone by.
It does, however, seem to be a meeting chamber of some kind - at the far end
of the round room sits a plain wooden chair.  Though ragged and torn, it
looks comfortable enough, a small footstool and a wooden end table next to
it.  Paintings and sculptures also abound in this room, of so many things it
boggles the mind.  Plants, animals, people, places, landscapes..  Not as
much for show as for simple storage.  What is most impressive, however, is
the large collection of books and tomes; several dozen thick and dusty works
piled up on a heavy table along one wall.

{ySoul Chamber of the Oak{x~
The heart of the tree remains in this dark, oppressive chamber..  And
where the Mirkwood King apparently gets his powers and longevity, as well as
that of the tree itself.  A throbbing, warm knot of wood sits in the center
of the circular room, held in place by two root-strands above and below. 
The whisper of voices can be faintly heard upon entry, as well..  But what
they say, is anyone's guess.  Nothing else seems to be out of the ordinary
visually in the chamber, other then the block of wood and a smooth channel
running around the base of it, in the floor.  There also appears to be a
round, wooden stool along the far wall, propped up.

now no longer stifling.  Thick, sturdy branches reach off in all directions
nearly as far as the eye can see, green and leafy.  It's home to an
impressive number of wildlife - squirrels and birds abound in the upper part
of the Mirkwood King's home.  Just don't look down; the ground is very, very
far from where you stand.  A platform of sorts has been set up here, along
one of the broader and flatter branches.  A plain wooden stool, carved in
the shape of a large tree stump, rests against one vertical branch, and a
small carved end-table remains near it.

their presence giving you a sense of curiosity and longing for adventure. 
The floor is caked with the dust of ages past, as you step towards a
darkening shadow in the wall, your footsteps leave marks in the dust,
marking your steps.  The shadow feels to stretch itself towards you, and you
reach out and step into the shadow's embrace, you find yourself in a whole
new land...  Away from the forgotten dusty chamber.

Before the Cathedral~
You are before the architectural wonder known as the Cathedral. Built of
ancient stone, not found in the world today, the structure is enormous.
Large stone statues in the form of gargoyles glare down ominously from the
facade of the building. The spires of the Cathedral reach high into the sky.
Stone carvings, depicting Bosco and his children before and after the fall,
frame the huge wood and black iron doors to the north. The steps of the
Cathedral are down.

Entrance hall to the embassy.~
You stand before the entrance to the High Embassy of the Lands of
Palankcaren.  The building is more like a castle.  {WA marble statue of
{BHELP{W's founders stands here, greeting all who enter.  {x To the west, it
towers above you, with a moat encircling it.  Fortunately the drawbridge is
down.  It has a very large tower that you can see climbing up to the sky. 
There is an east and west wing, containing various rooms and offices.  Above
you is a giant portal, probably back to Palankcaren, although you can't be
certain.  To the south, there is a shrine to the Goddess of Litazia.  The
shrine is not actually part of the Embassy, but is a pleasant attraction to
visit none the less.

Entrance hall to the embassy.~
You quickly discover that Palankcarians aren't cheap with their
embassies.  You stand in the entrance hall to the embassy.  There are large
pillars, made of pure gold supporting the buildings structure, with large,
stained glass windows at various intervals.  On one wall is a large map of
Palankcaren.  There are many small desks and tables lining this hall, with
secritaries and other social workers ready to do you biding on behalf of the
embassy.  To the west is a large staircase mounting up to a door marked
'Private.  ' That is obviously the true embassy, where only the ambassadors
may enter.  The room slopes slightly toward the northern exit, where to
large double doors lead into the Party Hall.

From the south exit of this room, there is a large staircase, which
splits and spirals down on both sides, down into the Party Hall.  This is
the largest room you have seen yet.  It could entertain thousands.  There
are large glass chandeliers hanging down from the ceiling, illuminating the
hall.  The walls have very large windows, with velvet curtains in front.  In
the far corner of the room, you can make out a small bar, with a barmaid to
serve you.  The centre of the floor has tables at one end, and a very large
dance floor on the other.  The hall would be perfect for anything from
weddings to Masquerade balls.

the focus point below is concentrated so as to make it easiest to open a
portal back to Palankcaren.  There is a balcony on the eastern side of the
room, looking down over the gates and moat.  There are small windows on the
other sides, letting light in.  Upon the walls are pictures of the various
Ambassadors.  The spiral staircase that led you here continues higher,
climbing up into the Great Portal itself.

furniture is a soft pink.  A large canopy bed is along the south wall,

velvet pillows.  Sitting up with the pillows are cute teddy bears and
stuffed bunnies, the whole room is filled with bunnies!  From the little
trinkets on the nightstands to the pattern on the curtains, they really are
everywhere you look.  A tiny little white spiral staircase runs up to
ChibiUsa's private balcony.  You try to fit up, but it is only big enough
for a little bunny to fit up.  Both of these rooms are obviously very
private, so please stay out if you have not been invited.

tower you saw before from outside.  There is a fireplace the north side of
the room, and various tables and bookcases throughout.  The floor has a
spiraled tile pattern, which meets in the middle.  This is the focus point
for all the magical power coming through the portal from Palankcaren.  If
you were to sleep in the centre of the spiral, you would absorb power much
faster.  A small door to the east leads back to the Entrance Hall, a door to
the west leads deeper into the embassy, and a small, spiral staircase which
circles the circumference of the room, leads up, higher into the tower.  To
the south are a set of heavy steel doors, leading to the Embassy Vault.

A Small Clearing~
Rolling green grass covers the ground here.  This appears to be a natural
break in the vast forest.  The west and south are lined with large trees. 
At the base of the trees, small flowers of many shapes and sizes color the
borders.  The clearing continues to the north and east.

Amidst the Trees~
All around you tall trees stretch as high as the eye can see.  The ground
is covered with a mix of forest debris.  To the south, the growth is too
thick to allow entry into the heart of the forest.  A small clearing can be
seen to the north.
