The spirit of the east is the finest katana imported to Midgaard, but
for a true Samurai, it is just the beginning. From now on, you will
need to gather the items and craft your own katanas, along 3 possible
paths.
 
If you wish to perfect a status related or physical damage katana,
the next step in your journey is to craft a 'katana tiger mauler'.
You will require a spirit of the east, combine it with 10 tiger
jewels, 30 shandalar diamonds, and the hide from a nearly extinct
tiger. Level required: 36
 
If you wish the perfect an elementally powered katana, the next
step in your journey is to craft a 'snowfall katana'.
You will require a spirit of the east, combine it with 10 blue
ice rings, 30 shandalar diamonds, and the spirit of winter.
Level required: 35
 
May the code of Bushido guide you!

darksteel zanbato katana~
Though mighty indeed, there is one final step that can be taken in
mastering the blade of physical strength. Using only the most rare of
methods, you can reforge your katana one last time using adamantite, and
sharpen it to an edge so perfect it is capable of slicing through the fabric of
space itself...
 
The 'adamantite nodachi katana' will require:
-a diamond whetstone
-an adamantite dragon shield
-50 shandalar diamonds
-this katana
Be warned that the first two items appear very rarely and it may be some time
before you can track them down. Keep your eyes open, and the Worldsplitter 
may yet be yours!

of dark things to come. Inscribed on the weapon in detail are the
methods needed to craft a 'dark vile orb'
 
Which is a vastly powerful artifact... it requires many rare
components including:
an icy manipulator orb to form the basic structure
shattered fragments from the 4 cursed gems of hell
bound together over a 12 step process each requiring
a single shard of darkness.

Valan's Diner~
The smells of baking bread and simmering stew lead you dancing through 
the doorway of the diner.  No greasy spoons to be seen here-- the 
booth walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood, 
rescued from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards 
carved and painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some 
musical or other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the 
wonderful smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window 
looks out over the Midgaard River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock 
and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south 
returns you to Austral Square. 
On most days you will find Valan here, testing a batch of stew or brewing 
a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for your arrival 
Pull up a chair, perhaps play a game, and take time out to talk.

River, and a boat or two floats lazily past.  Across the river you can see 
the Levee and the Guild of Thieves, but they seem very far away from all 
of this...

Meghan's Maps~
As you walk in, a sudden gust of wind enters the shop and sends several 
scraps of paper fly around the room.  You blink as the dust you've stirred  
up stings your eyes, and take a look around the shop.  This shop is cluttered  
with old pieces of parchment, stacks of books, and odd scraps.  A desk with  
slightly less clutter than the rest of the shop is in front of you.  A scroll  
case full of scrolls is behind the desk.  A bookcase is to the right of you,  
and to the left is a window overlooking the Common Square.  A small door,  
half hidden by a stack of books, leads to a room in the back of the shop.

Yakuza Hideout~
This room is decorated opulently with many spoils from the far east. 
Silk tapestries line the walls as well as a low table of mahogany.  You are
standing in the center of the local branch of the Yakuza; a group of ninja
assassins and spies from the far east.  It turns out setting up his shop
here was more than just another market for Sianghu.  
 
To the east you may acquire the tools you need to master ninjitsu, the
secret magic of ninjas, and to the west you may acquire exotic weapons
commonly favoured by ninjas.

A Small Shrine~
You have discovered a small and mostly unused shrine.  It appears to be
in a fairly poor state of repair.  Either due to intentional vandalism or
extended disuse, the paint is peeling, many floorboards are cracked, and the
ceiling is in shambles.  One thing seems to still be good condition.  A
large statue stands in the center of the room, a dedication to some female
goddess.  An acolyte to this deity stands nearby.  He is obviously the only
reason the statue remains untouched.  Perhaps closer examination of this
clergyman will yield useful information.
