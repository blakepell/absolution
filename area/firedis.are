stygis angel death~
Stygis, the Angel of Death~
Stygis, the Angel of Death, lands before you.
~
Stygis was once an angel, one of the gloried seraphim of the heavens.
However, the glamor of evil had tainted him, and he fell far down into the
fiery hells, where he has served as a servant of the dark lords since the
beginning of time. His handsome angelic appearance has been marred by his
chaotic nature, sprouting horns from his head, filling his mouth with
several strong, sharp teeth, giving him claws and talons, growing a tail,
even turning his feathery wings jet black, each wing growing a clawed hand
on top. He glares balefully at you through red eyes, as he handles his sword,
ready to take your soul to the netherworld.

Standing in the middle of all this snow and ice in this room is a huge white
dragon. It struggles to attack you, but you see that it's been chained to the
wall. No matter how hard it struggles with those chains, it cannot seem to
break them. From the look of things, this beast has been here since the initial
damning of the great tower. The dragon's presence explains why the rest of the
dungeon is cold, when the rest of the tower is warm.

Khervel Quickstab~
Khervel Quickstab is here, balancing a sharp knife on his finger.
~
Khervel is a halfling fighter and thief who's been hiding out in the dungeons
of the tower for some time. He's planning an assault on the Great Usurper,
Disteron, in order to free the land of the evil demon. In the meantime, he's
doing some nice freelance thievery to pad his pockets.
 
Eying the nice gear that Khervel is wearing, you notice that one piece
of it is part of a set that once belonged to Nimiss, a famous archer of
a sort. Some of the other pieces of "nimiss quickness garb" include:
 
some boots of speed
a pair of black velvet gloves
a black leather hood
leather leggings with a grey insignia
silk sleeves
velvet sheathes
 
If you find the entire set of Nimiss' Garb, you can combine it with
20 midgaard diamonds and craft it into a wonderful garment.
 
Good luck!

cainias demon~
the Cainias~
A strange, spiny, insectoid demon looks at you.
~
The Cainias is an oddity among the demons; it's a more studious type. However,
even the Cainias serve their purpose, for they learn all they can about the
world they visit, then this knowledge is used against the host land. The
spiny Cainias scuttles about on its insectoid legs, looking for anything
useful. It peruses you, shrugs, then goes on its way.

a tormented soul~
A strange tormented soul screams as it passes by.
~
The tormented soul is a spirit that has been condemned to roam the castle
forever more as part of its punishment for siding with Disteron. Too late, it
saw the errors of its ways and repented, but for now, it roams as a misty
spirit, doomed to relive its evilness in its mind.

a Manes~
A Manes crawls around, waiting to serve its master.
~
The Manes is a strange mindless, senseless creature from the foul pits of
hell. The fiend is a small bloated thing that looks at you with milky white 
eyes, and its claws and teeth look like they can go through a man. Sparse
hair tops its head as festering creatures crawl about on its skin.

A Spinagon flaps about and hisses at you.
~
The Spinagon is a small humanoid demon which, in many ways, looks like a small
gargoyle; it has wings, spines down its back, a spiky tail, and sharp talons
protuding from its feet. Although small, this fiend looks like it can destroy
beings much greater than itself.

A Succubus seductively rests here.
~
You blink, for you can't believe your eyes: the most beautiful woman in the
world stands before you. However, as you look at her again, you notice that
her eyes glow with an inner hellfire, and large draconic wings sprout from her
back. If it weren't for these clues, you'd have no idea that this woman is
actually a Succubus, a temptress demon from the pits. Even though her demonic
nature betrays her, she winks and smiles at you. An odd feeling starts to
overcome you, but you fight back; the fiend is obviously trying to charm you,
so that you'd end up giving your life essence to her.

An Abishai glares rather menacingly at you.
~
This gargoyle-like demon harbors no love for the humanoid races. The 
reptilian fiend hisses and snarls, as its long prehensile tail whips behind it,
and it flaps its wings in anger. It bellows with an abyssal fury, and you can
see lots of little sharp teeth in its mouth. Obviously, this beast is not one
to be trifled with.

A Bar-lgura leaps from tall point to tall point.
~
The Bar-lgura is one of the stranger demons you've ever seen. The fiend 
resembles a large reddish-brown-furred orangutan with grayish-brown skin.
Its long arms and legs end in six-digit hands and feet, each digit sporting
a sharp, wicked claw. The beast looks more at home in a tree, but looks ready
to fight anywhere.

An Osyluth marches about the room.
~
The Osyluth is a rather horrible-looking demon to behold. It resembles a
dried husk of a human; skin tightly stretched over bones. A large, scorpion's
tail protrudes from its backside; it looks ready to pierce someone's skin.
A foul smell of decay and rot pervades the room; you detect the source as this
fiend. It emits an odd rattling sound; is it speaking?

A Vrock caws at you.
~
The Vrock is a large birdlike demon that enjoys swooping down on its prey
and torturing it. The fiend resembles a human, although large wings sprout
from its back, its long limbs are covered in gray feathers, its neck 
stretches outwards, and its vulture-like head peers at you. The claws and
beak look rather sharp; this thing can most likely tear you limb from limb
without even trying.

The Cornugon is a great gargoyle-ish fiend from the hells. This large vaguely
humanoid beast is covered in scales, right from the tip of its spiky, horned
head, to the tip of its long, prehensile tail. Large wings jut from its back;
the fiend can obviously fly great distances. An odd scent of brimstone fills
the air; you sense it origniates from this beast...

The Glabrezu is a terrifying creature to behold, even for demonic standards.
The huge humanoid beast has four arms, two of which end in giant pincers, the
other two have more standard hands and claws. The fiend glares at you with
violet eyes set deep within its canine head; it growls, and you can see lots
of sharp teeth and fangs. You REALLY don't want to attack this thing...

its mandibles open and close. It flicks its spiky tail at you; it's obviously
read for a fight.

Right now, it seems annoyed at you...

yellow, green, black, brown, etc., all mix together in one sentient heap of
goo. Huge read eyes peek out in various places; they all glare at you.
From strange spouts on the surface, slime spurts out like lava erupting from
a volcano. He slides along on his own juices; you're getting nauseated just
looking at him, never mind his smell...

legs are goat-like with cloven hooves, even his head is goatlike, although
the horns atop his head are more like those of a ram.  A large, snaky tail
with a poison tip twitches from his backside, and huge bat wings flap in
anger.  You don't want him annoyed at you.

demons go; you find it hard to believe that this being is a demon.  He
appears as a bearded man with a kindly face, albeit with elfin ears, red
eyes, and a pair of horns sticking out from his forehead.  He dresses in
regal and expensive clothing; nothing is too good for him.  However, under
this kindly nature, you sense a great evil; perhaps you should not try to
annoy him...

Off the beaten path~
The thickness of the trees' branches prevents you from seeing the sky
overhead, although you have a fairly good idea of the time of day and
the weather.  An ever-so-faint scent of smoke hangs in the air, but there
is no evidence of fire in the near vicinity...

Further down the path~
A light, gentle breeze rustles the leaves in the trees as you continue on
down the path. Tracks made by occasional wagons and hikers have produced a
rather fresh dirt road, although it is fairly lumpy under your feet. Besides
the fresh scent of grass, plant and animal material, there is a distinct
smoky tinge to the air. Something's burning.

the air here must not be the greatest. There is a very definite smell of
smoke here, although you can't tell exactly what's burning. It seems warm
right now, even though the sun doesn't touch the ground much around here;
something else must be heating the vicinity.

Top of a hill~
The trees part for the first time, and the sun shines down upon you. The
fresh wind blowing in from the north is cool and refreshing. From your vantage
point, you can see more forest around you, along with mountains far in the
distance, and a town just down the hill, and a --
You blink. You can't believe your eyes! Reaching from the ground below, way
up into the sky, is an enormous pillar of fire! So this must be the fire
producing the smoke you noticed earlier. Strangely enough, even though it
is an enormous flame, it doesn't go beyond its current ground; it just stays
in one spot. What's even more interesting is the fact that there's a whole
town built around this fire! Perhaps it's a magical fire... although you
can't quite imagine any form of magic that would produce this!

This, too, is crossed out, and the board underneath it reads
WELCOME TO FARREACH
Thankfully, no other names have been added to the sign.

A field of clover~
You stand in the middle of a beautiful lush green field. Some rustic
fencework provides a little enclosure for animals to graze in. Around you,
forest provides a barrier between here and the rest of the world, except for
the hill you just came from. In the northeast, you can see a gigantic pillar
of fire reaching up into the sky. You wonder how the townspeople cope with a
raging fire in their own backyards.

Before the pillar of fire~
You stand before the great pillar of fire that is the center of the town of
Farreach. You can see a dirt path that leads off to the east and west around
the pillar; the townspeople must have built the town around this pyre.
You wonder how they can bear living with this in their town. More importantly,
you wonder how the fire keeps burning! You don't see any form of a fuel source,
nor do you see any sign of fire damage. Perhaps there's more to this than you
can see. Perhaps the answer is in the town... or maybe in the fire. You're
not terribly sure, but you think you see a gateway leading into the fire. What
lies on the other side? There is only one way to find out.

Holy Temple of Grace~
You stand inside a grand temple built ages ago. Huge murals reach up far as
the walls dare go, each one depicting a glorious battle, hero, or some
historical event that happened long before your time. Many lines of pews
progress down the aisle to the north, where they stop before a beautiful altar.
The light of hundreds of candles flicker as your movement disturbs the air
around them. You feel a divine warmth, not from the candles, but from the
temple itself, as you are invited to rest and relax from your travels.

fact that the whole place smells musty. You look, and realize that the whole
store is filled with stacks of blank paper, scrolls, manuscripts, and other
such materials for writing on. Pens of all sorts are lined up on the walls as
if they were swords. Vials of different coloured inks are sitting on a back
shelf. A sign on the wall reads, "Books bound while you wait!" You feel a
twinge of magic pierce the air as a stack of papers is picked up and bound
into a book. How interesting.

The burning gateway~
The fires separate before you so you can cross. You stand in a gateway of
sorts, where the porticullis closes. You can see a hall or a foyer or something
to the north, while the outside is visible through the dancing flames to the
south.
An odd thing about these flames: you can feel their warmth from where you
stand, but when you touch them, they do not burn. In fact, they feel no warmer
than the sun on a mild day. However, every so often you see some form of
spirit-thing fly from the northern gateway, but upon touching a flame, it
explodes into a tremendous fit of energy, and falls to the ground, burning
until there's nothing left. Perhaps these fires were not meant to hurt you;
maybe they were meant for something -- or someone -- else.

The foyer~
How strange! From the outside, you saw a great pillar of fire stretching up
into the sky! Now you stand inside the pillar, and you find yourself in, of
all things, a palatial foyer! The possibilities, as they were, are endless;
there's a castle sitting inside a perennial burning pyre? Or a tower? Whatever
it is, it bears investigation.
Every so often, you see a spirit being or some demonic thing ascend or
descend this enormous spiral staircase that graces the room. Now you see why
the townspeople refuse to enter. In fact, maybe they go about their lives
trying to ignore the fact that the center of their home is populated by evil
things or ghosts.

You are in an enclosed area just off the main hall. This looks like it was a

it's still a stable. You can see that the roof has been burned off and the
wall of fire is just above you, obscuring the sky.

the walls of this cell are completely coated in ice, icicles hang down from

a face drift by in the flames, no doubt belonging to some poor tormented soul
trapped within. The lounge itself has several nice reclining couches and end
tables for various uses. The style of the room is a tad decadent and ancient.
You can just imagine the wild parties that happened here, judging by the
several-times repaired furniture.

Dining Hall~
You are in a large dining hall for the residents of this tower. A rather
fancy dining table sits in the middle of the room, flanked by several chairs.
It looks like they have some nice banquets in this room! However, the room is
currently empty and there's no food... perhaps you better leave before someone
comes along and decides you're the next meal.

Kitchen~
You are in a kitchen bustling with energy as fell beings prepare for the next
meal. A wood stove (or perhaps a small fire demon in a cage?) cooks soups or
stews or something in lots of pots. A roast beef (beast?) cooks slowly over an
open flame in one corner. You feel somewhat underfoot and out of place.

Servant's Quarters~
You are in the servants' quarters. It's fairly squalid here; they must not
take care of their servants. Then again, they COULD be slaves, which would
explain somethings. A sign over the northern doorway reads: NO SLAVES ALLOWED.
THIS MEANS YOU. Must be important, whatever's in there.

The Antechamber~
You are in an antechamber to a bedroom. From the contents of the room,
you surmise that this room is used as a powder room for some woman. A huge
mirror dominates the south wall right next to the doorway. Nice couches sit
scattered across the room. A beautiful fireplace with mantelpiece occupies
the north wall. A huge painting of a woman hangs on the west wall. Underneath
the painting is a desk covered in papers. The eastern door is blocked by
translucent, sequined curtains. You catch a glint of gold just beyond...

Ashamel's Bedroom~
You are surprised by what you find before you: the entire floor is made of
gold! More specifically, the entire floor is covered by a mound of gold, and
this is what you're walking on. On closer inspection, you notice that the
mound of gold is actually several hundred (perhaps thousand?) gold coins,
fused or melted together. What you find odd is that there's a HUGE indentation
in one side of the mound, almost like something tried resting in the mound.
Scattered about the room are lots of soft pillows. But no bed.
A window looking outwards reveals the same old wall of fire that's been
burning ever since you got here.

because this room is a private sanctum, rather than the public reading room

ever-burning wall of fire that surrounds the pillar.

You stand in a tower off the main castle in the pillar of fire. This tower
has been exposed to the burning flames of the hells for many years; it has
been reduced to little more than a standing ash structure that bends and moves
in the wind, raising questions about its safety. The floating soot in the

dark. A new sound greets you, that of a creature hissing with utmost
displeasure. You then hear something barking orders; this might be
a bit of a struggle...

room of the great Disteron himself? There is one way to find out. A somewhat

where he keeps all his treasures and such. As well, he must also use it as

Top of the tower~
You are surprised as you climb up to the top of the stairs.  Fresh air! 
You have reached the top floor of the castle.  The fires that burn around
the castle, keeping the creatures locked inside, burns just a couple of feet
above the parapet wall, then stops.  As you watch, a spirit tries to fly
above the walls, away from the castle, but is yanked down by some spectral
force.  Obviously, the fire exerts force all around the castle, keeping
those that are captured inside.  However, a sparrow flutters by and lands on
the parapet, confirming that those not held within can enter and leave at
will.  You look up in the sky, and see several demonic figures flying
around.  But if they're flying around, that means they're not trapped in the
castle, and that means that there is a way for the forces to attack the land
around them...

The Heart of the Void~
You are deep within the coloured void that exists within -- or without --
the tower of Disteron. The colours around you look inviting; perhaps you should
try to become one with them. One series of colours looks rather solid; upon
further examination, you realize that there is a throne before you, made out
of the void itself. This must be the home plane of... well, something. Either
that, or it's a pathway between the netherworlds and the mortal land. All you
do know, however, is that something -- or someone -- keeps this path open.

You gasp when you see what's before you: the great wall of fire itself! You
almost gasp again when you realize that there's no balcony, no floor, no
nothing under you; you almost stepped out onto thin air, and plummeted to your
death! Thankfully, you stopped yourself in time. You hold onto the stone
windowsill with all your might (and will) to prevent yourself from falling.
The fire's awfully close to you right here, although you don't feel any
pain when you pass your hand through the fires. In fact, yes, you can even
hold on to this fire! This is *very* interesting. You could probably leap onto
the wall of fire, but there wouldn't be a way of jumping back (not that you'd
really want to.) Care for some exercise?

On the Wall of Fire~
You are climbing along on the great wall of fire that surrounds the tower.
As you reach out for a handhold, a tongue of flame seems to leap out and beg

your skin, although you can feel the heat starting to numb your hands.

below you (because this fire burns the ground!), and you have a feeling
it'd be extremely painful for you to enter it...
