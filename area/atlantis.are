Sam Sailor~
Sailor Sam~
A burly sailor sits at his kiosk, smoking a pipe.
~
This sailor looks like he's seen his share of foul weather!  Retired, he
now makes his services available to the rest of the ocean-going people of
Atlantis.  His strong hands look like they could build a very worthy sailing
vessel.  Or tear one apart, for that matter...

A charmingly beautiful young woman smiles sweetly at you.

You are slightly taken by how pretty she is, but you must remind yourself
that whatever you might imagine, cannot possibly be!  You are sadly
enchanted by her light brown hair, combed sideways past her face, and the
sparkling eyes which look at you through her spectacles, framing an
angelic light face.  She wears dental work, but even that seems to add to
her appearance.

two elven boys to maturity, especially in a city such as this, has added

"You witness the remnants of a powerful artifact, a
legendary tool known as the "ring of adamantite spokes".
These razor sharp spikes are used by powerful warriors for
both offense and defense, and properly maintained they gleam
bright enough to chase away the darkness. They were forged
from:
 
12 bars of adamantite
7 spikes of crackling energy
3 gems of entrapment
30 diamonds from midgaard
 
The sample shown here has grown dim and useless with age,
but with the right skills, this legendary tool could still
be forged.
 
Good luck!"

On the Sea~
On the horizon, you can make out distant sailing ships through the

Waters near Atlantis~
The seas here recede slightly and become murkier as the water finds
itself closer to a shoreline.  Beneath the water's surface, you can see
multicolored fish swimming by beautiful coral formations.  The fog clears
somewhat to reveal a definite land mass to the north.  Back south, and
everywhere else, you see only mile upon mile of clear blue sea.  The outline
of sailing ships becomes clearer in the distance.

north, the waters crest and lap against the sandy beaches of a large island.
On the horizon you can see that there are buildings on the island.  You
suddenly realize that there are no birds calling anymore.  Apart from the
dull roar of the sea, there is an eerie silence about this beach.

opportunity to relax a moment as you travel through the hazy climate of this
island.

view is filled with only the sandy beach and the trees in the distance.  You
have reached a corner of the island, and you see that travelling further
north will bring you toward rockier terrain.  You hear faint sounds of
activity over the dull roar of the surf.

orange peels.

ship docked at the port.  The beach becomes firmer and graduates into
a stone roadway leading east toward the inner city gates.  There is a
great deal of movement as people carry barrels and crates to load and
unload the many ships docked here.  As you look out into the western
horizon, you notice many more ships out on the sea.

and recede back into a stone walkway leading east into the city.  As you
walk by, you come across a number of sailors angrily pushing their way past
as they gather toward a run-down sailboat at the pier.  There is talk of the
boat, whose origin is unknown.  You sense distaste and wisely back away.

the dense forests you see further south.  This used to be a part of the busy
sea port, until some years ago when it was suddenly abandoned.  A metal
grating covers a large hole which appears to lead underground to the sea.

Beach Dunes~
If you wondered at all where the island inhabitants put all the sand they
dug out to make their western sea port, you wonder no more.  The beach
changes from flat sands to large, hilly sand dunes.  The winds and the tides
have formed fascinating patterns in the sand, leaving behind shell fragments
and seaweed.  The city walls lie to the east, and an unending expanse of
water fills your view to the horizon.  To the south, the western sea port
bustles with activity.

vegetation along the sand, staining it with a bit of a green colour.  The
air here seems stiller than it was before.  You cannot place anything
specific, but you feel as though there is tension in the air.  You also feel
as though you are being watched...

You cannot escape the feeling that you are being watched as you explore
the northern area of the beach.  Something in the air doesn't seem quite
right, and it's not just the smell of dead fish.  You ponder this carefully
as you look over the edge of the island, which drops sharply here about 20
feet to meet the seas.  You marvel at the way the sea water has cut patterns
into the sedimentary rock.

Atlantis must be thriving.  The city looks majestic, and the seaport to the
south looks particularly interesting.  There are people on the beach to the
east.

high.  Below you, the sparkling waters of the clear, blue sea lap at the
shores.  This spot is popular with the local fisherman, and you see a number
of them resting by the rock edges.  Their lines have been cast out and form
glistening threads in the air, catching the sun.

rock which appears to be well-occupied, a path leads south toward the city
gates, and more beach lies further east.

entrance.  You hear the sound of a sailing ship making its way across the
sea somewhere to the north.

is perched precariously by the shore, tied down with a rope to a nearby
tree.  Its nets are well used and smell of their catch.  Fishermen from the
boat are on shore, preparing their fish to be sold and to be cooked.  It
smells even more strongly of fish further north.

The Fishery~
Ships are anchored out in the sea just east of here.  It is a perfect
fishing spot, and the bulging nets the men draw in are distinct proof of
that fact.  Most of these boats have identifying markings of Atlantis
itself, so they must have sailed here from the sea port to the west.  They
don't come too close to shore, though; it's very rocky in the water near the
shore, and not terribly safe for approaching ships.

By the Fishery~
The people here are hard at work, not stopping to chat, not playing.  It
looks as though everybody is preparing for something.  Nervous sailors keep
their eyes trained on the horizons, scouting for that which you know nothing
about.  The fishing boats, which have sailed here from the sea port to the
west, haul in their daily catch quickly, and efficiently.  There is little
celebrating over good catches, like you might expect.  These men are
unsettled.  Perhaps it is your presence that bothers them.  After all,
you're not supposed to be here...

Splashing.  People shouting.  Nets flapping.  Sails being blown by the
wind.  Barrels creaking.  Ropes being pulled and scraped along the sides of
boats.  The air is filled with the sound of activity as you approach the
eastern fishery.  An inviting cool breeze brings with it the smell of fresh
sea air, and freshly caught fish.

walls were being constructed.  Through the gaps in the forest you can see

What used to be a central district in Atlantis is now a very quiet
square.  The statue you see in the square seems to represent a historical
figure, likely a prominent, former ruler.  That era resulted in marked
changes in the political and economical atmosphere here, and this area has
become a monument to those great days.  A classy looking establishment lies
to the north.

And the workmanship is surely among the best you've ever seen.  The wooden
door leading south is carved with strange looking, seemingly ancient runes.

the city.  The tall, yellowing, stone buildings reflect sunlight in your eyes.

The ocean stretches out in all directions like a shimmering emerald blanket,
forming a marked contrast with the brown and black coast line of the island.
The city itself seems much larger than you'd thought, there being a whole
section of the city in the south that you'd not previously noticed.  There

been well used, but the fine layer of dust betrays its abandonment.  The

walls would have offered them protection and covertness.  Faint glows of

without light.  What appears to be a junction opens up in the west.
