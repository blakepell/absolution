sym jester~
Sym~
A lithe jester frolicks in the shadows.
~
A cartwheeling flurry slows momentarily to resolve itself into a slim,
green-clad figure crowned by a tassled jester's hat.  Stitched in gold
across the right and left breast pockets you notice the words:
"Sym"
and
"To wonder is to grow"
The left pocket is partially tinted with grass stains.

A white marble statue of a young girl stands next to the book, one foot on
grey pedestal.  Her attention seems half focused on the book, half gazing at

a statue of the Dreamer~
A marble statue of the Dreamer stands here.
~
A female figure of indeterminate age has been sculpted from white marble.
The chiseled face is upturned, the stone eyes gazing at nothing, as if lost
in either the past or the future.  The statue gleams in the light, untouched
by time or weather.  But then, it doesn't look like the Dreamer will ever
belong to the present.
 
You can steal some of the power of dreams for yourself if you dare, and
craft yourself the "grey tinged cowl". You will require:
-a dark cowl
-13 shattered dreams
-13 innocent dreams
-100 midgaard opals
 
Good luck!

The little gnome appears to be a gardener.. that is, he dances around snipping
at things with no apparent plan or reason..  Surprisingly, the garden looks
well cared for, although those shears he's waving around look sort of lethal 
to anything living that might get in the way..

~
A slender dark elven form stands before you, eyes glimmering with a
strange, cruel light which seems to glow in the darkness like twin flames.
The avenger is among the best in blade, stealth, and magic of the clan
and is sworn to destroy all who spill the blood of a Zdreni clan member.
Considered beyond the rank structure and fierce competition among
the clan members for status, the avenger is extremely loyal to all members
of the clan.  Shimmering above the collarbone is the form of a stooping
hawk over two crossed daggers.

Icy silver eyes seem to measure you with a glance.  The deathmaster

of the influence of his position and his ability to retain it despite
the power games of those below him.  The image of two crossed daggers
shimmers above his collarbone.

the Zdreni stalker~
A silent figure stalks in the shadows.
~
A middle rank assassin, the stalker has trained extensively in the
arts of death.  Increase in status up to this level has been obtained
by consent of the deathmaster, as the assassination of other clan
members while below this rank is cause for immediate death.  Rise in
rank for the stalker from now on will come only through the assassination
of one of higher rank.  Hence, the stalker seeks to hone his abilities
to perfection, for a failed assassination attempt means instant death,
and those above him are anything but strangers to the art.

its foul blade can slay even the toughest foe as it is known for its

mark gabrian white insignia hair~
an inscription is woven in gold around edge of the mark:

  Take my hand
  and fear no longer
  Take my hand
  and cry no more..

  Reaching into the icy darkness
  and for an instant
  a glimmer of laughter
  emerges from the depths of memory
  to brush his heart,
  before flickering away,
  leaving traces
  like threads of gold
  shimmering warmly in the darkness.

  Picking up the threads,
  he weaves them together --
  Together my friends.
  Forever my friends.

  And against the deepening darkness
  Echoing in my ears,
  The golden roar of a lion.
