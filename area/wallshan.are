While Elves are not by nature particularly interested in war or soldiering,

adventurers. Some of them, such as this fellow, labor for the forces of
good, if the price is right.

Inside the Guard Tower~
You are standing inside the northern guard tower at the west gate. This
tower is a circular affair approximately twenty feet in diameter and forty
feet high. Straw has been scattered across the stone floor, and some plain
but functional wooden furniture has been arranged about the room for off-
duty guards. A spiral staircase winds its way up to the next floor in one
corner. A fire burns merrily away in a hearth to the east, the smoke
escaping through a small shaft that runs up one side of the turret.
A wooden door is set in the south wall.

You are standing inside the southern guard tower at the west gate. This
tower is a circular affair approximately twenty feet in diameter and forty
feet high. Straw has been scattered across the stone floor, and some plain
but functional wooden furniture has been arranged about the room for off-
duty guards. A set of dominos and a small pile of silver pieces suggest that
a friendly game between some guards was recently in progress. It seems the
guards were called away in a hurry, for they left their winnings behind. A
spiral staircase winds its way up to the next floor in one corner.
There is a small wooden door set in the northern wall.

tower is a circular affair approximately twenty feet in diameter and forty
feet high. Straw has been scattered across the stone floor, and some plain
but functional wooden furniture, deeply scored with dagger cuts, has been

hearth to the east, the smoke escaping through a small shaft that runs up one

The writing says-

"Now my charms are all o'erthrown, and what strength I have's mine own;
 which is most faint; now, 'tis true, I must be here confined by you, or
 send to Naples. Let me not, since I have my dukedom got and pardon'd the
 deceiver dwell in this bare siland by your spell; but release me from my
 bands with the help fo your good hands. Gentle breath of yours my sails
 must fill, or else my project fails, which was to please. Now I want spirits
 to enforce, art to enchant; and my ending is despair, unless I be reliev'd
 by prayer, which pierces so that it assaults mercy itself and frees all
 faults. As you from crimes would pardon'd be, let your indulgence set me
 free". (The Tempest, Epilogue)

Base of Northwest Tower~
You have reached the bottom of Northwest tower, the huge tower at the
northwestern corner of the walls of the City of Shandalar. It appears to serve
as some sort of storage area, being as it is full of weapons and armor.

To the north there appears some kind of great vault, recently uncovered after attempts to expand the walls.

Base of Northeast Tower~
This room is dusty and full of cobwebs. It probably hasn't been entered in
ages. Coughing, you make your way through a jumble of debris, looking for
another exit, but you find none. You do spy several torn scraps of what
looks like scrolls scattered about, though.

The Top of Northwest Tower~
This room is the quarters of the Guards Provost-Marshal, Glenwellucan Mad-
Llleweleucam. He is a rather senile old veteran of more wars than he could
possibly count. The room is littered with memorabilia, probably worth a
fortune to a collector, but useless to you. Then again, maybe not...

The Roof of Northwest Tower~
The Marshal uses this area as a relaxation area. There is a deckchair and
a small table, for use on sunny days- the Marshal sports a very healthy
tan.  There is a trapdoor set in the floor.

The Battlemages' Quarters~
Here reside the battlemages currently in the employ of the City. As they
spend little free time doing anything but meditating or learning new spells,
this room has little of interest. There is a bookcase full of scrolls, but
none of them are magical.  There is a trapdoor set in the ceiling.

The Roof of Southwest Tower~
This roof is totally featureless. Peering through the crenelations, you
get a good view of southwestern Shandalar, though. Due south lies a large
forest beyond which is lies the King of Dominia's castle.  There is a
trapdoor in the floor.

The Healing Chambers~
In this room, generous priests and priestesses of Lenny give up their time
to tend to the illnesses of the city guards. They will tend to others'
injuries as well, for a fee. Such is the way of Lenny.  There is also a
trapdoor in the ceiling.

The Roof of Southeast Tower~
This roof has been recently swept clean, and a stone altar erected to the
Gods. The sun is caught by a reflecting crystal so that it shines directly
onto the altar at all times during the day. The effect is quite splendid.
You feel totally at ease in this place.  There is a trapdoor set in the floor.

A Dusty Chamber~
This room has an evil feel to it. The smashed furniture, bloodstains and
broken bones are bad enough, but in addition there is a definite evil aura
to this fell domain, as if some foul deed has been perpetrated here. You
get the distinct feeling that this place is haunted.  There is a trapdoor
set in the ceiling.

The Roof of the Cursed Northeast Tower~
This roof has not bee visited in a long time. The trapdoor is covered in
silvery mystic runes, as is the stone around it. A chill wind blows here,
at all times, and birds have been known to die when flying too close. It
is truly a cursed place.
