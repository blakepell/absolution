0 DIKU~
Original game idea, concept, and design: 

Katja Nyboe [Superwoman] (katz@freja.diku.dk)
Tom Madsen [Stormbringer] (noop@freja.diku.dk)
Hans Henrik Staerfeldt [God] (bombman@freja.diku.dk)
Michael Seifert [Papi] (seifert@freja.diku.dk)
Sebastian Hammer [Quinn] (quinn@freja.diku.dk) 

Developed at: DIKU -- The Department of Computer Science
at the University of Copenhagen.
~ 

55 DISPERSE~ 

DISPERSE: The idea is to shoot certain objects all over the mud, and giving
the certain item to mobs all over, but not forcing them to wear it.
~ 

53 ADDRECRUITER DROPRECRUITER SWAPLEADER LEADERCOMMANDS LEADER DELEGATE~
.
Syntax: addrecruiter <your password> <new recruiter> 

-This command advanced or sets the trust on a member of
your clan to recruiter stats. You require a free recruiter
slot for this to work. 

Syntax: droprecruiter <your password> <old recruiter> 

-This command demotes a current recruiter in your clan
to level 51 or removes the trust on them. This frees up
a slot for a new recruiter. 

Syntax: swapleader <your password> <new leader> 

-This command drops you to lvl 51 or removes your trust as
a leader. It also replaces you with a new leader who is 
promoted. 

Syntax: delegate <recruiter> <level> 

- Delegate is a powerful ability the leader of a clan can 
bestow on his most prized recruiters. When the recruiter is 
delegated, that person gains the ability to loner people in 
the clan. The recruiter can loner people up to level 52 or the 
set level, whichever is lower. 

(See also 'help CLANSTATS' 'help CLANMEMBERS' 'help PRICES' help 'LONER' help 
'ACCEPT')
~ 

0 CLANSTATS CLANMEMBERS~ 

Clan leaders may request from the IMMs a list of their goon and clan hall
stats, as well as a list of current members, twice a year. Once during the
first week of February and again during the first week of August. Clan
stats and a list of clan members can also be requested in the event of the
take over of a new clan leader.  

(see 'help LEADERCOMMANDS' and 'help PRICES')
~  

0 GOLD SILVER MONEY~ 

Midgaard's economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the lowly copper,
which you, as an adventurer, are far too proud to carry). Gold coins are 
worth 100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the pound, 
as opposed to 100 to the pound for silver). Gems can be bought to alleviate
weight problems from the Midgaard's jeweler, who charges a mere 10% more 
than they are worth. 10 gems weigh one pound, and can be worth more than 100
gold pieces for the highest quality stones. 

You can also deposit your money on a bank note. See 'help bank' for more
information.
~ 

0 BRIEF COMPACT~ 

Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact removes 
the extra blank line before your prompt.
~ 

0 DEAF~ 

The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpful if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players. You can still use reply (see 'help reply') 
to reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a deity (it's mostly 
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~ 

0 AFK~ 

Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
replay. This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells. AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off. You may also type 'replay' while AFK. 

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay when they reconnect (unless, of course, the character
logs off before reading them).
~ 

0 54 BUILDER~ 

Level: 54 [BUILDER] 

These Immortals are the area builders of Redemption. You might never see a
level 54 IMM since they are usually WIZI when they are on-line. Level 54s 
should not accept money for upgrades or hand out punishments. They only
quests they can run are trivia quests. They have no other powers. 

~ 

0 55 RETIRED~ 

Level: 55 [RETRIED] 

These are visiting immortals or retired immortals who wish to just relax
for awhile from their normal position. They have no power to run quests,
accept money for upgrades, or hand out punishments. 
~ 

0 56 DEMIGOD~ 

Level: 56 [DEMIGOD] 

These immortals are here to help the game go along a lot smoother and 
easier for everyone, interacting a lot with mortals. They're not here to 
powertrip or be vengeful, but to make the game fun in their own little ways. 

These IMMs are supposed to be builders or run quests. They can enforce 
many of the MUDs rules. 

You can ask these people for the following:
-Restrings for role-playing purposes ONLY
-Mild forms of help (ie reimbursements after a crash)
-quests and tournaments
-RP titles
-Accept money for upgrades, but not give them out
-Cash in equipment, weapon, and restring vouchers
~ 

0 57 GOD~ 

Level: 57 [GOD] 

These immortals are here to help the game go along a lot smoother and 
easier for everyone. They're not here to powertrip or be vengeful, but to
make the game fun in their own little ways. 

These IMMs are just a little more powerful then the 56's. Their quests are
tough, and must be part of the role-playing atmosphere. 

You can ask these people for the following:
-Restrings for role-playing purposes ONLY
-Mild forms of help (ie reimbursements after a crash)
-Beg for quests, tournaments
-RP titles
-Cash in equipment, weapon, enchantment, and restring vouchers
~ 

0 58 DEITY~ 

Level: 58 [DEITY] 

These immortals are here to help the game go along a lot smoother and 
easier for everyone. They're not here to powertrip or be vengeful, but to
make the game fun in their own little ways. 

These IMMs are here to help the lower level Immortals with quests and
other odd jobs. They're most likely to be found doing the more complex 
quests and are here to make your gaming experience fun. 

You may ask these people for the following: 
-Restrings for role-playing purposes ONLY
-Mild forms of help (ie reimbursements after a crash)
-Beg for quests, not too often, cause their prizes are nice.
-Aid with clan affairs and politics
-Cash in equipment, weapon, enchantment, and restring vouchers
-role-play titles
~ 

0 59 CREATORS~ 

Level: 59 [CREATORS] 

These immortals are here to help the game go along a lot smoother and 
easier for everyone. They're not here to powertrip or be vengeful, but to
make the game fun in their own little ways. 

These guys are here to watch over mortal and immortal behavior. They're 
here to regulate the game and deal with all the stuff that the IMPLEMENTORS 
don't want to deal with. So if you see one of these IMMs online, and you 
have the need or urge to talk to a level 60, talk to the 59 first. They can
deal with almost any problem a mortal might have. 

You may ask these people for the following:
-Restrings for role-playing purposes ONLY
-Mild forms of help (ie reimbursements after a crash)
-Elaborate quests (which don't happen often), cause their prizes are nice
-Aid with clan affairs and politic
-role-play titles
-clan hall/outpost upgrades
~ 

0 60 IMPLEMENTORS~ 

Level: 60 [IMPLEMENTORS} 

They are in charge of setting rules, maintaining game balance, and keeping
the code working. If a lower-level IMM is on who can help you please ask them
first.
~ 

0 IMMORTAL~ 

Redemption will periodically ask for player applications to fill new IMM
spots.  To be seriously considered, the applicant will be a level 51 character
with superior game knowledge, no history of cheating, and time to dedicate to
improving the game.  A player who has another character that is either a clan
recruiter or leader will *NOT* be considered for an IMM position. All new IMMs
will enter as level 54.

Level 54 IMMs will be Builders.  Her/His job is to build an original area on 
Redemption. Once the area is finished and approved the IMM can begin testing 
the area with morts. A level 54 IMM who has done good work building will be 
advanced to level 56 when a position becomes open. As a level 56 this IMM has
the option of beginning other areas or running quests.  

Level 56 IMMs will have the most direct player contact and are expected to 
encourage characters to role-play. The duty of a level 56 is either to 
build areas (see above) or run elaborate quests preferably based on the 
mud's theme. Most questers will be recruited from the ranks of the 51 
mortals or be a promoted 54 builder. They will deal with simple mortal
interactions, such as running touraments are redeeming vouchers. 

Level 57+ IMMs will have deal with more complex tasks. For example, creating
an FAQ, OLCing clan modifications, or maintaining an updated item list. So
long as an IMM performs the task s/he was assigned do to, s/he will maintain 
their IMM level. If an IMM does not adequately do her/his job that IMM will 
be [ Retired ] to level 55 or put back as a non-clan mortal.

When in combat, the first physical attack on you will be directed at your 
mirror image, thus preventing all physical damage done to you. Your mirror
image might shatter, making you vulnerable to following attacks. This does
not affect magical spells being cast on you during combat, only physical 
attacks.

~ 

0 DEATH~ 

When your character dies on Terra, you are reincarnated back at the Altar 
of the Temple of Midgaard. If you die on Dominia, you are reincarnated at
the Temple of Selina in Shandalar. If you joined a clan, you will be 
reincarnated inside your clan hall or outpost. Your corpse is left behind 
in the room where you were killed, together with all of your equipment. 

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death. 

You lose experience points for dying. The amount you lose is two-thirds of 
the way back to the beginning of your level. 

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real 
time). Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve
objects from a non-clanners corpse. Clanners may loot any other clanner's 
corpse with no negative repercussions. If the game crashed after you died, 
it's a good bet that you lost it. Please do not go begging to an immortal to 
help you get your equipment back - it's not their duty to get it back for you.
~ 

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~ 

Your character advances in power by gaining experience. You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points. 

You gain experience by:
-killing a creature on your own.
-being part of a group that kills a monster.
-getting better at a skill or spell. 

You lose experience by: 

-fleeing out of combat. 10exp
-recalling out of combat. 25exp
-being the target of energy drain spells.
-dying. 

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many 
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your 
alignment versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have 
been killed lately; your total hours; and some random variation. 

Once you level, several things happen. You gain a certain amount of hit
points, mana points, and practices, depending on various factors. You also
gain some movement points and one training session. Your experience points
until you next level is reset. You will also be able to wear new equipment, 
and gain access to new skills and spells.
~
0 PET PETS~ 

You can buy pets in the pet shop. You may own only one pet at a time. After
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement. Your pet will follow you
everywhere you go and help you in your adventures.
~
0 SEEKERS~
This is the abridged version of the help file, containing only what prospective
members need to be immediately aware of, as well as giving an outline of Seeker
and what it stands for. Despite that, it is perhaps the most confusing set of 
rules for any clan on this MUD, so please make an effort to follow the more convoluted
ones. They're fairly logical essentially, and every effort has been made to make 
them clear. 

Should you wish to consider gaining admittance into the clan, you must read the
complete help file on the clan web page, as it is a requirement for all members 
to have read and understood that document. The Seeker web page may be found by visiting: 


http://cs.uml.edu/(tilde)jvictori/seeker 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. CLAN STORY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


Once the world was at peace and we ruled in peace over a land filled with happi-
ness and joy. We learned pride in the wonders we could create with a mere thou-
ght, and in our pride, we learned arrogance. Supreme, we felt that we were above
all else, indefagitable, lords of all that we surveyed. Our father, Bosco, was
as nothing, weak and kind.  

Prideful children that we were, we revolted. The golden doors of Valhalla were
rent open, and Introit was spoiled for all. Spoiled children, we fought amongst
ourselves, and in our folly, we destroyed ourselves. Now, in the ashes of a 
world we ruined, we live and die as mortals. Alone and yet bound by blood, we
each seek a way back to our power and glory.  

The benevolent Bhaal Z'Amon formed a clan called Seeker where he sought the ul-
timate Redemption, and many came to came to seek with him. As time went by,
Bhaal realized he had created a haven formeditation and peace in a world where
impulse and war seemed to flow freely. As leader of the Seekers, he had reached
the pinnacle of his achievements, and Bosco, the father of all creation, saw 
this. He called to his fallen son to rejoin him as the first of his forsaken 
children to finally find their way back into the graces of his light. And so it
was that Bhaal Z'Amon, the Seeker of Redemption, ascended the stairs into the 
light of his father's eyes, leaving his glorious creation in the realm of the 
mortals. 

Even with the departure of Bhaal, the Seekers lived on to follow his spirit and
guidance. You are welcome to come seek with us, for each person needs to seek
their own path and their own way, so that by individual salvation, the world may
be saved. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


A common requirement of membership in any clan is to have read and understood 
all of the clan's policies, and to be dedicated to its cause. Seeker is no exception
to this generalization, but because of its peaceful and helpful nature, members
should possess some additional qualities. (see also: Recruitment)  

i. QUALITIES OF A SEEKER 

The first and foremost quality of a Seeker is a peaceful mentality. See-
ker is not a military or aggressive clan, and members should not be inter-
ested in killing, looting, or otherwise causing harm to others. Those 
were mistakes made in the past, and by seeking redemption we are trying
to undo them. While members of other clans may have discussions about
killing amongst themselves, Seekers should not show support for nor
involve themselves in such matters. 

Seekers must also be polite, honest, and respectful towards others. It 
is unlawful to lie or cheat, as well as it is to use inappropriate lang-
uage, threaten others, or openly call someone names. 

In addition to the aforementioned, Seekers must also be willing dedicate
some of their time towards helping others. Although this is a redeeming
task in itself, it also helps spread kindness and happiness throughout the
land. 

ii. ROLEPLAYING  

There is tremendous roleplaying potential behind the life of a Seeker, 
and members are welcome to take advantage of this and 
participate in the ever evolving saga of seeking Redemption.  

All members, however, should make an effort to remain in character at
all times on the gossip channel.. If you would like to make an out of
character comment, simply either place OOC: before the remark, or talk
to the person in private. In the same way, members should not openly
talk about their other characters, events that happened to their other
characters, etc. without first carefully considering such a comment and
ensuring that it is clearly marked as being OOC. 

The above efforts are simply to ensure that the game world remains fun
and interesting for those who want to explore and experience it, and to
ensure that it does not simply become a chat room. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. RULES AND POLICIES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


The following rules have been created to represent the clan's
ideals and principles. 

i. GENERAL 

1. A Seeker must stand for the clan's ideals and follow the 
aforementioned expectations. 

2. A Seeker's first loyalty is to his or herself, and then to his/her 
Master. Finally, a Seeker's loyalty is to the clan. 

3. Help any whom you can. Yours and the clan's welfare come first, but 
you should attempt to aid any who ask. You may refuse to aid those
who attack or otherwise disturb Seeker's members, those who are rude
or too demanding, and those that have been ungrateful in the past. 

4. A Seeker must obey those of superior rank. If there is a question,
it should be directed to a member of Master rank or above. The Grand
Master has final say in all matters. 

5. Seekers must seek a Master and follow him/her until they reach Master
rank. 

6. When ready, and with permission from his/her Master, a Seeker should
begin to work on advancing in rank by means of a quest. 

7. Seekers must display their rank in their title or as an RP title, 
and should wear it with pride and honour.  

8. Seekers are not permitted to place bounties (offer gold as a reward
for the death of someone else). 

9. A Seeker must take interest in the clan's activities, and must read
all notes posted on board 7 (Seeker clan board). 

10. A Seeker shall avoid death at all costs. Attacking another player is
forbidden except under circumstances as described below. 

11. 
- If attacked, Seekers are generally encouraged to flee from the fight,
but are permitted to remain in the fight and defend themselves should
they choose to do so. 
- Seekers are not permitted to pursue the attacker if s/he flees. If 
the attacker remains in the fight and is killed, Seekers may not loot 
and Must ensure that the corpse is safely back in the attackers hands, 
unless Ensuring the safety of the corpse puts the Seeker in question at 
great risk. 
- When confronted with persistent attackers, ask a Master how to deal
with the situation and notify the clan about the attacker(s), espec-
ially loners. If attacked by an allied clan, immediately report it 
to the Masters, along with all related circumstances. The allied 
clans will typically discipline or loner the offending member. Do 
not antagonize allied clans. 

12. The only exception that can be made to rules 10 and 11 is the fact 
that Masters and members of the House of Redemption (who have permis-
sion from a Master) are allowed to attack others for the purpose of 
clan defense. This is permitted under any of the following 
circumstances:
* If a Seeker is in active combat with an attacker, or is fleeing from
them, having already been attacked. By fleeing, it is assumed that
the attacked is still in immediate danger. If the attacked is already
safe, or "suspects" he will be attacked and is therefore fleeing,
this does not apply.
* If the clan hall or outpost is under attack, a Master may use any
means necessary to defend the hall. If the attacker flees however,
pursuit is of course prohibited.
* A Master may attack any unfriendly presence within the immediate
vicinity of the hall or outpost (this includes Ruined Temple, Seeker
Square and Guardian room) if said player is a threat to any Seeker
currently on, and has refused to or chosen not to justify his presence.
This is a last resort, and the Master must give both a chance toexplain,
as well as a warning, should the purpose of their visit not be friendly.
If that person lies about his intentions, so as not to be driven away,
he will not be given a chance to justify his presence in the future,
only a warning. (Again, should they flee, there is to be no pursuit. 
Even if they flee north from Ruined temple to Guardian room, they must 
be given a few moments to leave). This is a prerogative of Masters only; 
NOT HoR J-people. 

Note: Masters may also engage in defense of allied clans, but only by
means that will not directly draw them into the combat. Use ofspells 
like dispel and blind which hinder the attacker but do not pull you 
into the fight are allowed. Any defense of this sort is allowed only 
when the Master is certain that the allied clan-member did not initiate 
the combat. 

13. 
- Should a Seeker be grouped and the group is attacked, Seekers are 
permitted to remain in the fight in order to defend the group as 
long as the attacker is not of an allied clan. 
- If the attacker is of an allied clan: 
i. and has warned the Seeker of the attack, the Seeker must leave 
the group immediately, although warning your groupmates is 
certainly acceptable.
ii. but did not warn the Seeker of an attack, the Seeker may help
defend the group. 
- Should the attacker flee, and the group pursues, the Seeker must
immediately leave the group 

14. If you are killed, remain calm and polite. 

15. Seekers are not permitted to duel members of other clans unless they
have express permission from a Master. 

16. In such cases where permission is granted, the duel may not be to the
death, and the member of the other clan must take the flag. 

17. Members of Seeker may not use injustice in duels, nor may they worship
Carnas or use injustice for any purposes whatsoever. 

18. Using steal or gravitate against other players is strictly prohibited, 
except to reobtain stolen or looted items, and this only with the 
permission of a Master. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IV. RECRUITMENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 

Anyone may apply to enter Seeker, and to do so, simply contact a member of 
Master rank or above. Before noting the Leader and the Recruiters about your request,
a Master will likely ask you a few questions. Once a Recruiter or the Leader has
contacted you, you will be given a standradized interview. Depending on the re-
sults, you may either be approved on the spot, or the Masters will vote on your 
admittance.  

A vote amongst the Masters is required for the recruitment of any character over
level 30, anyone who has previously been in Seeker (unless they went to an 
allied clan, in which case readmission will most likely be granted), or anyone who has 
repeatedly attacked or otherwise caused harm to Seeker or its members in any 
way. Depending on your background, you may be asked to prove yourself worthy of 
recruitment before an interview will be given.  

Before requesting an interview, you should have thought over your potential fut-
ure in Seeker, possess the Qualities of a Seeker, and read and understood the 
Rules and Policies. You should also be prepared to answer questions about why
you wish to join, personal goals, how you plan to contribute, and what you plan
to do in Seeker. Any questions you have on clan's rules and policies should be
directed to a Master before being recruited. 

If you are considering applying for admittance, be sure to read the complete 
help file on the web page, as this version is merely set up to give you a 
general idea about Seeker and what it stands for. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The original Seeker help file was written by the benevolent Bhaal Z'Amon, the 
founder of the clan. The help file has since been revised and expanded by 
Cardinal, the current Leader. 

Any concerns regarding this help file should be directed to a Master, a Recruit-
er, or the Leader, who will gladly answer your questions.

0 JUSTICE~
JUSTICE
Members are charged with carrying the LAW to those that would shun the path of 
RIGHTEOUSNESS throughout the lands. Becoming a MEMBER of Justice means SERIOUS

1. All flagged members of any clan including loners shall be hunted down and 
   killed. There is but one exception, as listed in Law 2.
2. Justice is allied with SEEKER. Seeker masters may retain their FLAGS. All 
   other Seekers must report to Justice for prompt reparation of sins.

   shall be treated as those with FLAGS until they change deities. 
4. No Justice member may group with a FLAGGED partner.
5. TRAITORS TO JUSTICE, that is, members of Justice who have left on undesirable

   individuals to be considered TRAITORS. 


**THE LAWS OF COMBAT ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE. If in doubt, ask a 
member of the Leadership for confirmation. 

V-The Law of Self

includes but is not limited to learning the locations of regions and items, 
bettering one's combat skills, and helping others.

Members of Justice, HAND chosen by Kaisho, who have demonstrated exceptional 
loyalty and devotion to the cause of the Just. Often called upon to bring 
Justice to those who worship Carnas or otherwise require FURTHER punishment than
the normal laws ALLOW. Inquisitors are to be RESPECTED, and have the 
responsibility of the care of the clan when the Leadership is not present. In 
the absence of a member of the Leadership, the word of an Inquisitor is FINAL.
Inquisitors are ABOVE the law and are said to be acting in DIRECT extension of 
the will of Kaisho. NEVER ask Kaisho for the rank of Inquisitor. Or suffer the 
consequences. Flags ALLOWED.

REMEMBER 
*JUSTICE is NOT a democracy.
*Nor is it a refuge for the WEAK who prey on others, or a safe haven for the 
LAZY or STUPID.
*Those who seek refuge within the ranks and do NOT live by the strict code of 
the JUST will be CULLED at the FIRST opportunity. Apply to the ranks of the 
JUST with much AFORETHOUGHT and TREPIDATION.

0 AMAZON KINDRED~ 

Only Chaos.. and thus it stood as time marched forward. 

Only Chaos.. small ripples of order began to appear on the fringes of the
blackness. Lines and patterns emerging and solidifying. Members of Kindred
-Samael himself- began forcing laws and expectations upon members,
eradicating the Chaos they clamed to follow. His laws, and rules bound
Kindred within angry confines, and the black inky blot of Chaos was now
laced with structure and law. Seeing this law emerge and form and become
part of the once free Kindred, Samael's followers rebeled at the lies which were
told, and overthrew Samael. With a set of new proclamations, a gargyle named
Gibetto forged the law of Kindred. "Evil yes, but we must not fight within.
We must setup a few laws which will govern us and make us stronger. We
must be as one, fight as one unit." Gibetto spoke unto the the crowd, as
she stood over the slain Samael with bloodied sword and dented armour. 

"The laws are simple, and merely mean to bind us together, not hold us
back.", and with that, Gibetto left, returning shortly with a stone table
of engraved words of the 3 laws of Kindred. 
 

The first law of Kindred - Code of Kindred
Kindred are first among people and with that it is beneath them to
aid non-kindred, or seek aid from non-kindred unless there is no other
recourse. You need not treat non-kindred with respect, you need not
treat them fairly. You need only respect your own. This means you should
avoid grouping with non-kindred, if you do your group may be attacked
without warrning and you may find your self lonered for assising the group
against Kindred. Worship also falls under this catagory, Kindred may
use the gods and the gifts they provide, all except the pacifist Bhaal. 
 

The second law of Kindred - Ranks of Kindred
There are 4 ranks within Kindred. They are taken through power and strength
and kept by earning respect for the strength you wield. 

. The first rank is that of Leader, this is the first among Kindred.
. The strongest Kindred, they are responsible to lead and direct
. the lesser members. 

. The second rank is that of Recruiter. These 2 are the right and.
. left hands of the Leader. They ensure that the leaders directions
. are carried forth, and should be the first to challenge when the
. leader shows signs of weakness. 

. The third rank is that of Elder. There is six seated Elders. They
. are the wise, they are the strongest of the Kindred. These Kindred are
. expected to lead war parties and direct lesser kindred. 

. The fourth rank is that of Kindred. These are all other Kindred,
. ranging from a new recruit to old semi-retired Kindred. 
 

The third law of Kindred - Right of Challenge
Any Kindred may challenge any Elder for their place. An Elder may
challenge a Recruiter with the surport of ether the Leader or Recruiter
and atleast 3 other Elders. Only one challenge may be issued to an
individual, you may not challenge the same person multiple times if
you lose. If you win, the loser has the right to a rematch and is
placed in the next rank down, taking the winners position. There is
no penalty for failing a chalange, except the ridicule of your
peers and the loss of this right against that person. Challenges
are held in the Kindred maze, the only things which are banned is use of
curative devices and aid from other members once the fight begins. 

Admitance into Kindred 

Kindred is currently invite only. Do not ask us. There are no requirements
beyond that we ask you. Again, don't ask us.

0 VENARI PRAGMATI~
========================================== 
Venari - Guardians of Dominia, Scourge of Dragons
 
{RGreetings traveller, you wish to know the history of Venari? Harken to
my tale... {x

Selina was akin to Bosco long ago, before memory and lore. Though 
spirited, she grew weary of Terra (as Bosco's realm was named) and its 
inhabitants, for the wyrms had begun to multiply in startling numbers,
and she hated their arrogant nature. Anticipating their eventual rule, she
fled the lands, and with her will parted the waters of the Dragon Sea to
reveal a vast new land, uncluttered and serene. She created new children to dwell
on Dominia; from that time on, gargoyles, trolls and slivers roamed 
unrestrained without fear or hatred, and Selina was content. Being weary
of her labours, she forsook the Mortal realm and departed, never to be seen
by Mortal eyes again.
   
However, the peace on Dominia was not to last. After the fall of
Bosco, the proud wyrms attacked Selina's realm with a vengeance, seiging 
the lands and marring her works. Then, as all seemed to be lost, a group of
defenders, led by the warrior StarCrossed, rose from the ashes and fought 
the wyrms. War ensued, with many heroes born and lost, but much of the 
knowledge of that age was lost in the heat of battle (thus, this story is 
told as a legend). Finally, the wyrms were driven from the capital and cast
into the Dragon Sea, forever exiled to Terra. StarCrossed, who had escaped
unscathed, gathered her warriors and together they forged the clan Venari, 
the Dragon Slayers of Dominia, Guardians of the East, and upholders of 
Selina's will.

Years passed, StarCrossed departed to the realm above, and yet we
still remain, ever stalwart in our beliefs. Many wise and venerable leaders 
brought Venari into a new age where dragons are scarce. Verily, the
Kenshin invade our lands, but we will uphold our oath to purge the heretics,
lest we induce the wrath of Selina above us. Venari will not falter, and as long
we do not stray from Selina she will protect us; for we are her heirs,
and only through our efforts will her legacy live on. Long live Selina's
will and the will of the Venari!

1 KENSHI HARPERS~

The Tale of Clan Harper:  

It seems but a few decades ago, it all began. A secret meeting was held between 
Xelne, Xuthal, Xalne and Tzigane in the shadow grove, marking the first
peacefully organized discussions surrounding clan Harper. There was much talk of
a mounting force, though not hostile, in the lands beyond.  

Great warriors trained their skill at the sword, and their hearts with honour.
They were the sole challengers for the great plough of land set forth by the
great Immortals for a new beginning on Dominia. I, Sabrina, Master of Kenshi,
was their leader. It was decided that Tzigane, Queen of the Gypsies, would
attempt to unite the WindFoot tribe and her own, to form the great Hierarchy
known as Harper.  

She set forth law on the lands of Dominia and fiercely defied one and all to
challenge her. She earned great respect in the hearts of many adventurers. She
built a great castle to her cause, and filled it with her knowledge of culture
and beauty. She had many children.  

She turned to the Followers of Kenshi, and welcomed them among her children.
They fought by her side, taught, and were taught, and became great members of 
Harper, though never losing their faith. Yet, as the tides continued to turn, as
the moons continued to shine, as the years continued to pass, the great despair
of the land became stranger to her no more. She grew conscious of the fickle
nature of creatures upon one another. She took to heart the lack of honour in
the land. She died slowly each day hearing of one or another forest torched in
the name of some cursed dragon hunt. Until she could bear no more. In a quiet
ceremony in the castle's antechamber, she stepped down from the throne one last
time, never to grace it with her presence again. She chose to follow her evil
side, as it had yet to wrong her, and gave her great power.  

This is the tale of the coming to be of the art of the Kenshin:  

The night was calm. It was so perfectly at peace that nothing would dare disrupt
the beauteous sanctity of its silky smooth sky. Sabrina looked up from the
oracle that surrounded her and peered deep into the sky towards the mysterious
stars above. She knew not what they were. Though scholars had told her what they
are, she did not know them, she could not touch them, understand them. Yet, each
night as she looked up, contemplating her meaningless existence, she knew the
world was not devoid of all hope. She knew the stars had the answer, somewhere
deep in their midst. Somehow, this night felt different. It was vibrant, alive,
culminating full of energy raging in search of a purpose, a release. "What?"

What are you trying to show me?" "I don't understand!!!" Sabrina looked up
daringly, and outwardly thrust her sword in the air to challenge the gods to
show her the way! A flash of light beamed across her eyes, nearly blinding her
as she screamed aloud! The light steamed down deep into her eyes as all the
stars reflected at once off the gleaming metal of her polished katana. The sword
glowed with radiance as she tried to watch its metamorphosis. The light
enveloped her, and carried her deep into the recesses of her mind. The message
she had sought all her life was beginning to form. The turmoil, confusion,
enlightenment and awe became her as her mind stretched to understand the purpose
of this powerful force. She heard it: "The Way of Kenshi; The Way of the Sword."
Her mind was lashed free of the grip of the light, and she fell into the devoid
pit of her own soul once again. She collapsed from the experience, certain of
nothing but that the end had not yet been written.
A young human adopted to the ways of Kenshi, by Sabrina herself slept soundly in
his chambers, when he awakened to a thunder within the halls, he rushed into the
Queens chambers but she was gone. A vile force had removed her from what was
rightfully hers. After making preparations to remove the new Lord of the Demons,
as Dael crowned himself, Courage approached him with a ultimatum, step down from
the throne or I will kill you and take it. Surprisingly enough Dael walked away
without shedding a drop of blood. He immediately called his best runner to
deliver a message to Sabrina calling her home where she belonged. A few days
later a figure awakened Courage from his deep slumber, rubbing his eyes
profusely, he realized it was Sabrina, he immediately hit the floor, kneeling
before her. He said "My queen I have unseated Dael to return you to your
rightful stature." She said, "Lord Courage do you not see they all are following
you, not me, I have trained you in the ways of Kenshi, it is now your turn to
continue my vision, and complete the goals we have set in the name of honor."
Courage sighs sadly. As she hands him the crown she says, "Do not be sad young
human, I am very proud of you," she shakes here head, smiles happily, and says,
"for a human you never cease to amaze me." She seems to disappear into the dead
of night, with nothing left but the crown she gave him.  

Courage draws his holy blade, and rises to the challenge, vowing to never let
the name of Kenshi die.

The sword, flawless yet cunning, merciful yet deadly, perfect in the perfect
hands, evil in service to the unjust, it is the basis of all existence. When
Sabrina awoke, her mind had been reborn. She raised her katana and gazed in awe
at her reflection. Through that reflection she saw the new world she was
destined to create; she knew her sword would be her best companion on that
journey. She made a sacred vow: "I will bring balance and harmony to the world,
and my sword will be my guide" Over the next few years, she recruited many
skilled fighters to join her in her training. She practiced the way of the
sword, the way of honour, respect, the way of energy, the way of stealth and the
ways of balance. Her final result was the art of Kenshi. Her and her followers
became known as Kenshin. Powerful, yet gentle souls that follow the way of the
sword and value honour above all else. Sabrina set the foundation for a great
dynasty of followers forever more. She created a unique system of levels that
recognize the accomplishments of her members, give them a path towards
redemption for the ways of the past. She placed two of her best swordsmen to
stand by her side in the sometimes-difficult task of leadership, as advisors to
her ways. They have long loyally defended the ideals of her legacy. Together,
they strove to put honour, balance and harmony back into the world. At times
when evil reigned, they provided relief and help to those around and offered
kindness to those in need. Through others, the holy goodness obliterated evil,
they followed a dark path to destroy the good armies and restore pain and
suffering in war. Their greatest challenge was to not let anything get in the
way of their hopes and their knowledge that redemption can only come when true
balance is achieved. Followers of Kenshi must accept the sword as heir guiding
force and value honour above all else. They must be proficient in sword skills
so that they may protect others and themselves. Evil cannot exist without good
and good cannot exist without evil. They are they ideals of Ying and Yang,
positive and negative, hot and cold, darkness and light that the sword
embellishes so well. They join a dynasty in its forming and enter a unique
ranking system based on honour, courage, strength and cunning intelligence. A
new follower will begin as a White Sash and will display this in their title. As
they grow in age of mind and body and learn new skills of life, they may ascend
to Elite.

0 TICK~ 

Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting. 

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called 
the 'tick'. Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the 
actual amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds. 

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; 
less often (15 minutes) if someone is. Because areas take so long to reset 
if someone is in the area, it is generally considered to be bad etiquette 
to sleep in an area, or sit in a popular leveling area doing nothing. 
Please avoid this, or else an IMM may be forced to take action, especially 
if you are known to be a repeat offender. Also note that objects lying on 
the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

0 HIGH EMBASSAY FROM THE LANDS OF PALANKCAREN (HELP) HELP~ 

High Embassy from the Lands of Palankcaren (HELP) 

HISTORY 

After a terrible accident, in which he lost all his powers along with his 
memory, Avacar came to this land in search of help. Over the years he slowly
relearned his craft, and his memory returned to him. Once he was strong enough, 
he opened a portal back to his homeworld, Palankcaren. There, he began his 
training once more as a Valocar, a Guardian of Balance. He returned to this world 
on many an occasion, for help, and to give help in return. Finally he came back 
into his true powers, and was whole once again. Unfortunately there was trouble 
back in Palankcaren, and a great war broke out. He asked for help from the people 
of this land, and received it. They returned home with him and helped him win the 
war. He then stayed in Palankcaren for a year to help with its reconstruction. 
Finally, he stood before the Valocarian High Council, and was given a new task. 
He was asked to open an embassy to the great world that had given Palankcaren 
aid, to help them when they needed it. He happily agreed. In the city called 
Stoneridge, he raised his hands, and from the very earth arose a great castle. 
A following of people from both worlds soon began to inhabit the castle, forming 
a new guild. It is the first permanent interdementional joining of efforts, and 
is called the guild of the High Embassy of the Lands of Palankcaren, or HELP for 
short. HELP now exists to offer assistance to all who need it, and to entertain
the people of both lands.

RULES 

1) New Members will be restricted to entrance at level 10, and above, no
   exceptions (other then those who have reclass/remorted) will be made. A 5,000
   entrance fee is required to pay the immortals. 

2) Non-clanners wishing to enter must note the current leadership, the Valocar, 
   the Regent, and the High Guardians. This note must contain the reason you
   wish To join and why you would make a good addition to the guild.

3) Members of the guild are still free to follow whatever path they so desire, 
   be it one of roleplaying or not. They are members but still separate people
   with separate views and beliefs. Roleplaying is suggested, but if you 
   roleplay counter that which follows the guild, there will be consequences. 
   This is to say that, you can roleplay if you wish, or not, following the 
   guilds roleplay, or not, but under no circumstances can you roleplay against 
   the guild.

4) Each member is responsible for whom they help and what they charge (clan
   members, this includes loners) for their services. If a member so chooses
   not to help a particular person that is within their right. If they choose
   to help you for free if you are in the clan system, then that is also
   their right. Each person is an individual. 

5) Things which members are expected to do: 
a) Help anyone levels 1-9 and 10-51 whom are nonclanners for no charge.
b) Help clan members and loners unless the clan member or loner is blacklisted. 
c) Make the best effort to help out with public guild events (such as
   mini-quests, balls, festivals, etc.) In the cases where prizes may be 
   awarded, an Immortal should be sought out, to help with this aspect. If 
   this is not possible, then money is always an acceptable reward.
d) Donations to help the guild are always accepted from its members, and 
   occasionally they may be requested to supply a certain amount to help 
   forward the guild in its efforts.

7) Members who break the rules will be suspended from guild activities and
   halls.

8) There will be a tribunal, which shall meet on a bi-monthly basis to discuss
   where the guild is going, future events, and review the rules. Also, players
   who have been kicked out of the guild, shall have to submit a request to be 
   seen before the tribunal to return.

9) Members are expected to be polite at all times. Talking with inappropriate
   language on in-character channels will not be tolerated. Some leeway is given 
   on out-of-character channels, but members are still expected to have some good
   taste.
   Also, acting rudely to other players is greatly frowned upon. If someone is
   acting rudely towards you using the hush command is recommended, and if they
   continue contact the immortals and guild leadership.

10) We do not tolerate people who become "guests" in our halls. Any member who 
    suddenly stops playing with no notice or are found to be abusing the guild's
    regeneration rates will be suspended. 

11) Members will not slander the names of others, especially other members.  If
    a member has a problem with another member they are expected to contact the 
    guild leadership.

12) Only the Valocarian Ambassadoriat and Regent may speak to the immortals for
    the guild.
    This includes upgrades and arranging guild events. The only exception is for
    the High Guardians who may, with consent from the Valocarian Ambassadoriat or
    Regent, add new members to the guild.

13) Members of HELP mat not join another guild and no person who is in another
    guild may join. This does not include private homes.

RANKS 

The leaders of the guild are the Valocarian Ambassadoriat, the guilds vital link
to Palankcaren, and the Regent, who runs the guild. These two people are the
ultimate Ambassadors to Terra and Dominia, and have the final say in all guild 
matters. These two are the only members who can speak with the gods on behalf of 
the guild. The Valocarian Ambassadoriat is Avacar, Valocar of Palankcaren, and 
the Regent is Cid. 

Below the Leader are the two High Guardians. These two are the hands of the 
leaders. They handle money, equipment, recruiting, and various other tasks. 
Contact them if you wish to join the guild. 

The Guardians of Balance are the true strength of the guild. They keep the 
balance of the arcane powers, and decide on guild matters. The Guardians sit 
upon the Tribunal. Advancement to Guardian level from Acolyte is at the 
discretion of the leadership. See below for information on Tribunal. Each 
Guardian represents a portion of the guilds population, and must consult them 
before voting on any Tribunal issues. 

The Acolyte is one who is studying to become a Guardian. They must have shown 
incredible examples of Helpfulness. They take lower Ambassadors under their 
wing and show them the ways of our guild. They act as an example on how to help 
others and the way our guild should act. They are also expected to give more to 
the guild: participating in more events, and helping to promote more 
mud-awareness of the guild. More even than the guardians, the Acolytes should be 
seen in the public eye. 

Finally, upon entrance into the guild are the Ambassadors. These are they who 
have come from Palankcaren to help the people of this world. Ambassadors do all 
they can to be helpful when they have spare time; gathering and freely giving 
information regarding directions to areas when requested, promoting the guild 
on all channels, particularly, gossip/music/shout/etc. 

Our guild also recognizes the accomplishments of being reborn, or pursuing a new 
field of interest. If you are to remort, you become a Trasma, or a reborn one. 
If you choose to reclass you become a Darma, a learned one. If both remort and 
reclass, you become a Tradarma, or Great One. Your ranks are handled in the 
same fashion. The current leader of the guild is a Tradarma. With these added 
powers and titles, come more expectation in your abilities. 

TRIBUNAL 

The guilds ruling body is its Tribunal. The Guardians sit upon the Tribunal and 
vote on rules, entrance of members, review old members, plan guild events, 
punishment, recruitment techniques, budget and various other points of interest.
They are expected to meet monthly, so as to keep up to date. Each Guardian 
represents a portion of the guild, and must consulttheir Ambassadors and 
Acolytes on how to vote. The High Guardians, Regent, and Valocarian
Ambassadoriat may attend tribunal meetings, and can express opinions, but cannot 
vote. On the other hand, all tribunal decisions are approved by the above mentioned 
leadership before going into effect. 

BENEFITS 

1) All members receive free spellups and Equipment.
2) Maxed regeneration rooms on Terra and Dominia
3) First guild to have a hall on Dominia
4) Sense of friendship and help with obtaining experience, knowledge and 
equipment
5) Cool guild events, such as festivals and quests!

0 MERCHANTS OF REDEMPTION GUILD~

Long ago, two sisters were walking the forests when they got lost. 
Unable to find their way home, they asked local travellers which 
direction of their home was. The merchants all smiled, saying they 
had a fee for this information. The prices these travellers requested 
was far more than the sisters had. Finding a friend in the strange new 
world, Aethya, they were given the idea to help people along the road 
in hopes to retrieve enough gold to pay the fee, and find their way 
home. Along the way one of the sisters, Nica, was summoned for a job 
by a handsome man, and quickly fell in love with him. The man,
Kazimieras, fell in love with Nica, and they married. Now, with 
husband, Nica was torn between her family she had missed and the 
love she found. When the time came to get the information, Nica and 
Rendalth decided it best to find a place to sleep, out of the 
wilderness. Brave Daisy built them shelter, which quickly used the 
funds saved to find their way home. From that day on, they knew they 
could not save the funds, needed to go home, without aid. They made
friends among the people they met, and quickly grew farther from 
the home they knew. Years later, Nica died. Gravely stricken by the 
loss of her sister, Rendalth opened the home to those who were close 
to the sisters. Nica's room, still untouched, has been made a shrine 
to those who were close to her throughout the time of her life.
 
To become a Merchant of Redemption you require to:
-Be at least level 10
-Produce the 5000 gold entrance fee on your own
Write a letter to Rendalth and Reme when you complete the obligations
to become a Merchant of Redemption.

Syntax: north
Syntax: south

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction. They can all be used 
by typing the first letter of each word.

~ 

55 FUCK~ 

Syntax: FUCK <PLAYER NAME> 

Fuck is an immortal command that will fuck the users terminal up, some more
than others. If you have to use this, use it wisely, as it is only a
temporary fix and not a solution to anything. Fucking a player forces them
to disconnect, as their terminal program will (in theory) not recover
without them disconnecting.
~ 

56 NOQUIT~ 

Syntax: Noquit <PLAYER NAME> 

This will remove a player's ability to quit from the game. This is to stop
people from making little newbies and spamming the note spool with shitball 
little notes, and other little knickknacks. NOTE: This will not stop a 
player from losing link, or even better, hanging up. 

If this is used for anything more then a deterrent, ie: as a punishment, 
post a note to the immortals. This is normally not serious enough of a 
command to really do anything that special. However, don't abuse this 
power either.
~ 

0 NOQUIT~ 

If a NO_QUIT flag is added to your playerfile, there is a reason this is
done - mostly because the immortal that is talking to you doesn't want you 
to quit for some reason. You may still lose link or hang up as that is 
your prerogative, but those aren't game commands. 

Also, when pkilling, you will not be able to quit till 5 ticks later.
This is to prevent people from fleeing and quitting, which makes getting
out of a pkill just too damn easy.
~ 

0 CAST~ 

Syntax: cast <spell> <target> 

It is easier to cast a spell after you have practiced it. The more you 
practice, the higher chance you have of success when casting. You may 
practice any spell up to 75%. Casting spells costs mana. The mana cost 
decreases as your level increases to a certain extent. 

The <target> is optional. Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat. 

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' <target>. Quoting is optional for single-word 
spells. You can abbreviate the spell name. Example: c heal <self> 

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully. 

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~ 

0 EXITS~ 

Syntax: exits 

Typing exits tells you the visible exits of the room you are in. Not all 
exits are visible. You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits. 
(Try to walk in a certain direction and see what you bump into). 

NOTE: Immortals, when typing exit, should always be able to see the room
names in all directions, thanks to 'Holylight'.
~ 

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~ 

Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get <object>
Syntax: get <object> <container>
Syntax: get all
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put <object> <container>
Syntax: put all.<object> <container> 

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.
Note: Objects with melt_drop will dissolve. 

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse. TAKE is a synonym for get. 

GIVE gives an object or some coins to another character.
Example: give 100 gold <target> 

PUT puts an object into a container. 

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~ 

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~ 

Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory 

EQUIPMENT lists your (worn) equipment (armor, weapons, float and held items). 

INVENTORY lists your (held) inventory.
~ 

54 IMMRULES RULES~ 

As an Immortal on Redemption you are expected to uphold certain standards.
These standards were put in place in order to maintain the fairness and
integrity of this mud. Failure to uphold the following guidelines will
result in probation, demotion, retirement, or deletion. 

1. Active cheating by IMMs will not be tolerated
This includes everything from setting the stats, hours, hp, etc. of your or 
other players morts; having a trusted or high level imm that Delstar has not
approved; pardoning killers/thieves without cause; snooping players without 
legitimate reasons; giving morts armor, weapons, money, etc.; enchanting or 
restringing mort's items other than as a quest prize; transferring morts in 
order to get them out of trouble or give them an advantage; providing morts 
with game information that gives them an unfair advantage; stating players 
without cause; creating or distributing *super* items or regen rooms; and 
other similar acts which unbalance the game. 

2. Cheating with a mort by a player who also has an IMM is unacceptable
This includes multi-playing, accepting favors from other IMMs, abusing bugs, 
etc. with your mortal characters. Because of the manner in which IMMs are 
structured on Redemption (entering as level 54s) it is imperative that 
players with an IMM be "trustworthy." So if a player who has an IMM cheats
in any manner with his/her mort it will be considered as an action that the 
players IMM will be disciplined for. 

3. Passive cheating is also grounds for punishment
This includes "turning you head" when other morts or IMMs cheat; not 
reporting *super* items, regen rooms, or bugs; and other similar acts of 
"non-action." Part of one's duty as an IMM is to maintain the fairness of 
the mud. By purposefully ignoring cheaters you are neglecting your duty.
This type of neglect is grounds for punishment. 

If you are unsure about the appropriateness of an action contact a higher
level IMM for assistance. In order to make this place enjoyable for
everyone (and allow IMMs to continue to have clanned characters) it is
essential that we follow these standards. If you are currently not in
compliance with *any* of the above standards it is suggested that you
rectify that situation immediately.
~ 

0 COMPARE~ 

Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object> 

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory. If both objects are 
weapons, it will report the one with the better average damage. If both 
objects are armor, it will report the one with the better armor class. 

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the 
object you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type. 

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~ 

0 FLEE RESCUE~ 

Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue <character> 

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it. If the fight is 
not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can RESCUE 
you. (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work, and costs more 
experience points than fleeing). 

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep 
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time. Your chances of 
making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience. 

(Also see 'NORECALL')
~ 

0 EXAMINE LOOK PEER~ 

Syntax: look
Syntax: look <object>
Syntax: look <character>
Syntax: look <direction>
Syntax: look <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>
Syntax: peer <direction> 

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see. 

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'. 

PEER allows you too see into the adjoining room.
~ 

0 ORDER~ 

Syntax: order <mob> command
Syntax: order all command 

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command. The command may have arguments. You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly. 

All charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed). 

Aggressive mobs lose their aggie flag when charmed. 

If you charm a creature and attack it, that will break the charm.
The more charmed creatures under your control, the harder it will be for 
you to exercise your powers over them. In short, the more charmies you
have, the harder it is to control them.
~ 

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~ 

Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake 

These commands change your position. When you REST or SLEEP, you regenerate
hit points, mana points, and movement points faster. However, you are more 
vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP, you won't hear many things happen. 

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position. You can also WAKE 
other sleeping characters.
~ 

0 GTELL REPLY SAY TELL RTELL RREPLY~ 

Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say <message>
Syntax: reply <message>
Syntax: tell <character> <message> 

All of these commands send messages to other players. GTELL sends a 
message to all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if 
they are sleeping, stunned or dying. ';' is a synonym for GTELL. 

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room. The single quote 
<'> is a synonym for SAY. 

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world. 

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL. REPLY will 
work even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity. 
This is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
~ 

0 NOTE 'NOTE WRITE' 'NOTE READ' BOARD 'NOTE SYSTEM' 'NOTE UPDATE' 'NOTE FORWARD' BOARDS~ 

Syntax: board [number|name] Shows or changes board.
Syntax: note Reads next note.
Syntax: note read [number] Reads a certain note.
Syntax: note remove <number> Removes a note written by you.
Syntax: note list [number] Shows up to number notes.
Syntax: note write Posts a note.
Syntax: note catchup Marks all notes in this board read.
Syntax: note update Marks all notes on all boards read. 
Syntax: note foward <number> <to> Forwards a note to another player
Syntax: note reply <number> [all] Replies with quoted originial note

These commands are used for the new note system. Instead of just one board, 
there are several, each with its special purpose.  

Changing between the boards is accomplished using the BOARD command. BOARD
without any arguments gives you a list of all boards together with number of
unread message. To change, type BOARD <number> or BOARD <name of the board>. 

To read next unread note, type NOTE. To read a note with a specified number,
type NOTE READ <number>. Typing NOTE while in a board with no unread notes
shifts you to the next board. Note that unlike the standard note system, a 
note has the same number in NOTE LIST and NOTE READ. 

Posting a message is as simple as writing NOTE WRITE. You will be moved into
interactive mode, where all you see are prompts for the fields like 'To:', 
'From:', etc. You will be automatically put AFK while writing a note. 

To see the list of the notes in the current board, type NOTE LIST. Typing 

NOTE LIST <number> will list only <number> of the last notes in the area. 

You can remove your own note by using NOTE REMOVE <number>. Implementors 
may remove other people's notes. Implementors can also select how many days
their note is kept before being purged. Purging happens automatically at
bootup. Purged notes are not deleted, but saved into a file. 

NOTE REPLY <number> will begin a new note with the original note quoted
in it.  Including the argument all will send the note to the all the
recipients of the original note.

To let only immortals see your note, address it to "imm". To let players of
a specific level and above, address it to that level (no other recipients 
may appear in that case). 

This board system was created by Erwin S. Andreasen, erwin@pip.dknet.dk, 
aka Phunk and is freely available. The general outlook was based on Mystic 
Adventure's note system (mud.gel.ulaval.ca 4000).

0 CHANNEL GOSSIP CGOSSIP SHOUT YELL OOC CLAN MUSIC Q/A SAY MIND LEAD QUESTION~ 

CHANNEL MESSAGE BRIEF NOTE:
Syntax: gossip <message> '.'
Syntax: cgos <message> 'cg' Cannot be used by non-clanners
Syntax: shout <message>
Syntax: yell <message> Area channel only
Syntax: music <message> 'm'  For the musician in you :)

Syntax: Q/A <message> '?' Questions and Answers
Syntax: say <message> ''' Room channel only
Syntax: lead <message> For clan leaders and recruiters ONLY
Syntax: mind <message>   For slivers ONLY 

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world. To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter. 

GOSSIP and CGOS are variants of SHOUT (without the delay). '.' is a
synonym for GOSSIP. 

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area. 

MIND is a special channel that connects all slivers to the grand hive.
Essentially, it's a telepathic connection between slivers where they can
talk about things. QUIET mode will not turn off this channel, nor will
simply typing its name. 

Type a channel name by itself to turn it off.
~ 

0 QUIET~ 

Syntax: quiet 

Quiet mode will turn off all channels for you, thus preventing you from
receiving input from these sources. You can still send messages on these
channels while in QUIET mode, however.
~ 

0 HUSH~ 

Syntax: hush <player>
hush 

Hushing a player will cut off all communication from that player. That is,
you will not hear anything that player has to say (no gossips, says, emotes,
beeps, etc.) 

To see a list of people you have hushed, type 'hush' by itself.
~
0 EMOTE PMOTE POSE SOCIAL~ 

Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose 

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions. Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK
(type socials or help socials for a listing). 

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's
name (i.e. pmote bonks Shemabuku will be read as 'X' bonks you by Shemabuku, 
and as 'X' bonks Shemabuku by everyone else). 

POSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.
~ 

55 SMOTE~ 

Syntax: smote <action> 

Smote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere 
in the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room. 

(also see 'help emote' and 'social')
~ 

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~ 

Syntax: hold <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear <object>
Syntax: wear all
Syntax: wield <object> 

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start 
using it as equipment. HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves. 
WEAR is for armor. WIELD is for weapons. 

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory. 

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does 
not match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced 
enough to use it properly. 

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.
~ 

0 CREDITS~ 

Syntax: credits 

This command shows the list of the original Diku Mud implementors. This 
version of ROM 2.4 beta 3 has been hacked and modified by: 

- Maclav
- Delstar
- Shemabuku
- Gwendoline/Loran 
- Mierauch

COMMANDS shows you all the commands in the game. 

REPORT shows your current statistics to you and also announces them to 
other players in the room. SCORE shows much more detailed statistics to

that let you type 'who idiot', 'who impotent', 'who ignorant', etc...
~ 

0 MEDITATION FAST HEALING~ 

FAST HEALING : Causes one to regen HP up to double the normal regen rate.
MEDITATION : Causes one to regen MANA up to double the normal regen rate.
NOTE: The social MEDITATE does not improve this skill.

starts with a '+', the part after the '+' is appended to your current
description, so that you can make multi-line descriptions. You can delete
lines by using description -.
~ 

0 LOOKUP~ 

Syntax: lookup <player> 

This command allows you to look at another player's description from 
anywhere on the mud.

NOTE: Please write down your new password until you have become accustomed
to typing it.
~ 

0 TITLE~ 

Syntax: title <string> 

Sets your title to a given string. 

The game supplies a title when your character is created and when you
advance a level. This option can be toggled at any time by typing 
autotitle. You can use TITLE to change your title. 

NOTE: This feature is given to add a more personal touch to your character
and should be used for ROLE-PLAYING. 

IF: If an immortal tells you that your title needs to be changed, then 
change it. There is a damn good reason behind it, normally because another
mortal found it offensive, or it's simply in bad taste.
~   

0 WIMPY~ 

Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number> 

WIMPY sets your wimpy value. Your wimpy value cannot be set about 50% of
your total hit points. When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to 
flee. You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. 
has not been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not 
been tripped or bashed by an enemy. 

NOTE: You will ATTEMPT to flee. Wimpy is not a guarantee that you will 
get away safe. 

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit 
points, but setting your wimpy to 1hp will not make you run away when you 
hit 1hp. You will certainly die.

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page (the 
default is 24 lines). Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disable paging.
~ 

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~ 

Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff <potion>
Syntax: recite <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap <target>
Syntax: zap 

-BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff. 

-QUAFF quaffs a magical potion; as opposed to DRINK, which drinks mundane 
liquids. 

-SCROLL recites on self or target, depending on the nature of the scroll.
The scroll must be in your inventory at the time. 

-ZAP zaps a magical wand at a target. If the target is not specified,
and you are fighting someone, then that character is used for a target. 

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP. 

All of these commands use up their objects. Potions and scrolls have a 
single charge. Wands and staves have multiple charges. When a magical 
object has no more charges, it will be consumed. The mage spell 'recharge' 
may be used to recharge items. 

These commands may require an item skill to be successful. See the help 
entries on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~ 

0 CONSIDER~ 

Syntax: consider <character> 

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate.
~ 

0 FOLLOW GROUP~ 

Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character> 

FOLLOW starts you following another character. To stop following anyone 
else, just FOLLOW <yourself>. 

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands. If anyone in your group is attacked, you will 
automatically join the fight. This can be toggled using the autoplayerassist
and automobassist toggles, for whether you wish to join in a fight against
a player or a mob, respectively. 

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group. Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you. 

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group. 

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own. 

NOFOLLOW will stop people from following you, and you from following people. 
This is also an option to allow people to follow you in the first place, 
and not to be allowed to follow you. 

(also see 'experience')
~ 

0 VISIBLE~ 

VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility or
oculary, making you visible again.
~ 

0 KILLER THIEF~ 

(KILLER) flags are a marker that show someone was aggressive towards 
another player. This will cause guards and protectors to be aggressive 
towards them. 

(THIEF) flags are a marker that someone tried to steal something from 
someone and failed to do so. Anyone with this flag alone will receive a 
(KILLER) when attacked. 

To remove one of these flags you must die to another player other than a 
fellow clan mate. In odd situations a immortal may pardon this flag... as 
long as there is a VERY good reason.
~ 

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~ 

Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: SAVE 

SAVE saves your character and object. The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving. Typing save
will block all other commands for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generates too much lag). 

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved. 

QUIT leaves the game. You may QUIT anywhere. When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room. 

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just 
one command. Nevertheless, it's a good idea to SAVE before you QUIT. If 
you get into the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some 
other mud that doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it. 
Quitting outside of the town, or designated hall will cause you to lose exp. 

There is no RENT in this mud. Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to 
leave.
~ 

0 RECALL~ 

Syntax: RECALL 

RECALL prays to a continent's god for miraculous transportation from where 
you are back to the either Temple of Bosco or the Temple of Selina. '/' is 
a synonym for RECALL. 

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for 
fleeing), and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for 
fleeing). This chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% 
recall does not ensure success. 

RECALL costs half of your movement points. 

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms. Characters afflicted 
by a curse may not recall at all. 

(Also see 'help NORECALL')
~ 

0 NORECALL~ 

Norecall is a new option that allows you to have the option to RECALL
while link dead and in the middle of combat. Type 'auto' to see if you 
have this off or on. 

(Also see 'help RECALL')
~ 

0 SPLIT~ 

Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold> 

SPLIT splits some coins between you and all the members of your group who 
are in the same room as you. It's customary to SPLIT the loot after a kill.
The first argument is the amount of silver the split (0 is acceptable), and 
the second gold (optional). 

Examples:
split 30 --> split 30 silver
split 20 50 --> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split 0 10 --> split 10 gold
~ 

0 STEAL~ 

Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character> 

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character. 

There are penalties for using STEAL on other players. 

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~ 

0 PRACTICE~ 

Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell> 

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you. You can check this anywhere. 

PRACTICE with an argument practices that skill or spell. Your percentage
varies from 1% to 75% that you can adjust by training the skill/spell. You 
may attain 100% by using the skill or spell. You must be at a guild master 
to practice spells and skills. 

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session. The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will have 
each time you gain a level. Unused sessions are saved until you do use 
them.
~ 

0 TRAIN~ 

Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana quest> 

TRAIN increases one of your attributes. When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several initial 
training sessions. You can increase your attributes by using these 
sessions at a trainer (there are several in town). 

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase mana 
or hp by 10. You receive one session per level. 

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON. WIS gives you more
practices when you gain a level. CON gives you more hit points. In the long
run, your character will be most powerful if you train WIS and CON both 
before practicing or training anything else.
~ 

60 ADVANCE~ 

Syntax: advance <character> <level> 

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value. It is the only 
way to create new immortal characters within the game. ADVANCE may also be
used to demote characters.
~ 

60 TRUST~ 

Syntax: trust <character> <level> 

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level. This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, etc. You can give more trust to mortal (or immortal) 
characters to give them access to more power without messing up the 
character. You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level. 

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~ 

58 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~ 

Syntax: allow <site>
ban <site> <newbies|all|permit>
ban 

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in. BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites. ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner. 

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or 
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidentally lock out too many 
sites with a wildcard. Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~ 

59 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~ 

Syntax: reboot
shutdown 

Reboot shuts down the server. When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot. 

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it. WARNING: This command is to never to be used unless
you have an approval from the IMPs.
~ 

56 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~ 

Syntax: wizlock
newlock 

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to REDEMPTION. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 51), except for link-dead players who
are returning. Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning. Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the IMPs. 

A god must be at least level 58 to wizlock the game.
~ 

59 DENY~ 

Syntax: deny <name> 

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable. It may only be removed by editing the file - for this 
reason freeze is usually preferred. Deny is to be used only in an extreme 
situation. If the deny is used, post a penalty note.
~ 

57 DISCONNECT~ 

Syntax: disconnect <name>
disconnect <descriptor number> 

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the 
telnet prompt. This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and 
annoying players. Note that this command is logged, and abusing it will 
cause the 59+'s to ask questions.
~ 

56 FREEZE~ 

Syntax: freeze <name> 

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than the deny command.
NOTE: Post a penalty note if this command is used.
~ 

56 FORCE~ 

Syntax: force <character> <command>
force all <command>
force players <command>
force gods <command> 

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.
Below level 57 (God), force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable. You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example.  

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command. This is 
typically used for 'force all save'. Beware of 'force all drop all', 
as this is blatant misuse and the abuser will be questioned on the matter.  

NOTE: Forcing all to change their 'clean' role-playing style is frowned 
upon. 

FORCE 'players' and FORCE 'gods' does the same as FORCE 'all', but on the 
respective character groups.
~ 

56 SOCKETS~ 

Syntax: sockets
sockets <name>  

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in. The two numbers inside brackets are 
the channel number and the 'connected' state. The 'connected' states are 
listed in merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of 
logging in. 

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or it can be used to
identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched 
into an orc). 

NOTE: socket @*.ca will show you all the people logged into our mud from
Canada.
~ 

56 IDENT IDENTIFY~ 

Syntax: ident <player> 

This command allows you to see the specific account that a player is logged
in from. It is useful for characters that are playing from similar sites,
e.g. freenet6.carleton.ca. By using ident, you can better determine whether
or not they are multi-playing, or what account a spammer is logging in from.
~ 

54 LOAD OLOAD MLOAD~ 

Syntax: load mob <vnum>
load mob 2*<name>
load obj <vnum>
load obj 2*<name> 

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs). The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stating an existing mob or object. 

Load puts objects in your inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they 
are put in the room. Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. 
Old format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, 
new format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(See also clone, vnum, stat). Try to avoid loading objects that are off-
line. There is a reason for it, so make sure they stay that way. 

mload and oload are abbreviations for load mob and lob obj, respectively.
~ 

58 SET~ 

Syntax: set mob <mobile> <field> <value>
set obj <object> <field> <value>
set room <number> <field> <value>
set skill <char> <name> <rating>
set skill <char> all <rating> 

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given. Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile. 

(see also 'help string' 'help stat' 'help flag')
~ 

56 STRING~ 

Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
string mob <field> <string> 

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile. A full list of fields can be viewed by typing 'string obj' or 
'string mob'. Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported, unless you 
sit there and count the spaces. 

Most screens are 80 lines long. So if you do the math, you can have mutli-
line restrings. 

NOTE: Do NOT make strings that are not medieval, e.g. Guns, Bombs, etc.
~ 

56 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL NOTITLE NONOTE~ 

Syntax: nochannel <character>
noemote <character>
noshout <character>
notell <character>
notitle <character>
nonote <character> 

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication. 

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music, etc.) on the 
game. Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels. 

Notitle allows you to keep a player from changing his/her title. This is
especially useful if you wish to keep a character from running around with
vulgar titles. Simply restring his/her title to something acceptable then
notitle them. 

Nonote is used to stop a player from abusing the note boards. Such abuses
include repeated spamming of note boards, vulgar notes, etc. 

NOTE: Please post a note when any of these commands are used.
~ 

57 PARDON~ 

Syntax: pardon <character> killer
pardon <character> thief 

Pardon pardons a player for their crimes. Don't pardon a player unless you
are sure they deserve it.
~ 

54 VAPOURIZE~ 

Syntax: vapourize <object> 

Totally annihilates the object. Isn't affected by no_purge flags, unlike
it's weaker cousin, Purge.
~ 

54 PURGE~ 

Syntax: purge
purge <character> 

Purge is used to clean up the world. Purge with no arguments removes all 
the NPC's and objects in the current room. Purge with an argument purges 
one character from anywhere in the world. 

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Tetragon). Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name. 

Purging a player causes the player to quit from the game completely, just
like disconnect, expect for you get a groovy little message.
~ 

56 RESTORE~ 

Syntax: restore <character>
restore room
restore all 

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character. It also heals poison, plague, and blindness. 

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every 
player in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. 
Restore all is only usable by creators and implementors. Restore should be
used sparingly or not at all.
~ 

57 SLAY~ 

Syntax: slay <character>
slay <mob> 

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw. Best not to use 
this command on players if you enjoy being a god. This is a form of a 
strict punishment, and is used for catching multi-players who pass eq from 
one character to the other. PROOF must be needed to use this at anytime. 

NOTE: A penalty note MUST be posted if this command is used on any player
at any time.
~ 

55 TRANSFER TELEPORT~ 

Syntax: transfer <character>
transfer all
transfer <character> <location>
transfer all <location> 

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 

Note: "Transfer all" is usually a VERY bad idea. 
~ 

0 NAME SNOWY~ 

Thanks to Snowy for finding us a name for this wonderful mud. It originally
was named 'Nightmares' as a temp name just to give us something to work with.
After going online, our little flower Daisy came up with our story line, and
from there everyone was told to figure out a name that went with it. Well, 
again... thanks Snowy.
~ 

55 AT~ 

Syntax: at <location> <command> 

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given 
location. The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of a mobile,
or as the name of an object. 

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the command, 
and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your location). 

EXAMPLES: 

Syantax: at bosco where
Syantax: at bosco look bosco
Syantax: at bosco look
Syantax: at bosco give diamond bosco
~ 

55 ECHO GECHO PECHO ZECHO~ 

Syntax: echo <message>
gecho <message>
pecho <character> <message>
zecho <message> 

These commands all perform similar functions. Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it. Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target. Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo. 

PECHO should never be used for imitating another person or player - this 
just causes headaches and trouble. GPECHO is often used to inform mortals 
that a certain Immortal has logged onto the game, and is willing to talk and
help any mortal with a problem. 

ZECHO is used for area echoes. Anyone in the same area as you will see your
echo.
~ 

54 GOTO~ 

Syntax: goto <mob>
goto <vnum room>
goto <object name> 

Goto takes you to a location. The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object. 

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain god 
level. 

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms. 

(also see 'help violate')
~ 

54 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~ 

Syntax: holylight
wizinvis <level> 

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game. With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily. Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see. 

NOTE: This does not see people sneaking into or out of a room. *sigh* 

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will make you invisible to all players 
of a lower level than your invisibility level. It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given. Wizi 60 characters are totally 
invisible.
~ 

54 INCOGNITO~ 

Snytax: incog <level> 

Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside 
the room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you. It 
takes a level argument similar to wizinvis. People at that level or higher 
can see you regardless of location. 

This is also nice when combined with the WIZIN command. Using Wizin 50 and
INCOG will allow anyone who is level 51 to see you in the room. A level 30
could not. Just a nice little technique.
~  

54 MEMORY~ 

Syntax: memory 

Memory reports the size of your mud. 

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and 
objects, not the number of instances currently in the game. 

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings. These strings 
have a maximum limit, which is also shown. 

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks. There is no 
limit on the number and size of these blocks. 

58 and below should not have to worry about this. Yes, you have it, but it 
means nothing to you!
~ 

54 VNUM~ 

Syntax: vnum <name>
vnum <obj or mob> <name>
vnum skill <name> 

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results. Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search. This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name. 

(see also 'help load')
~ 

54 STAT~ 

Syntax: stat <name>
stat mob <name>
stat obj <name>
stat room <vnum>
stat clan  

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or 
room within the game. Without a class argument, the command will return a 
object (if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a 
room (if a number is given). 'Stat room' with no argument stats the room you
are standing in. Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto. 

(see also goto, transfer) 

NOTE: If you're going to stat a player, they're also considered to be mobs. 

Syntax: stat mob <player name> 

STAT is NOT to be used by a 55 or below to stat any players. If you are 
found doing so, there better be a good reason, otherwise you will be 
considered cheating, and will be punished in some kind of fashion.
~ 

54 MWHERE OWHERE~ 

Syntax: mwhere <name>
mwhere
owhere <name> 

MWHERE shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
Mwhere alone will show you where all the players are online and what mobs 
other immortals are in. 

OWHERE shows you where objects in the game can be found, giving you the vnum
of the object. 

There are no commands yet that give you the name of rooms in the game. 

(also see 'help vnum' and 'help load') 
~ 

59 OBJDUMP~ 

Syntax: objdump <ALL|AREA> <filename> 

ALL: Dumps the information for all the area files loaded in the game 

AREA: Dumps the information for the objects in the area the character is in.

~ 

56 PEACE~ 

Syntax: peace 

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~ 

54 POOFIN POOFOUT~ 

Syntax: poofin <message>
Syntax: pooffout <message> 

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and 'leaves 
in a swirling mist'. You can replace these messages with messages of your 
own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands. These messages MUST 
INCLUDE YOUR NAME somewhere in the string. 

You may also type just POOFIN or POOFOUT just to see what your current 
POOF'S look like. 

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you. 

(see also goto)
~ 

0 NOSNOOP~ 

Type 'channel' to see if you have the no_snoop flag still. This is ONLY 
given to people with a good reason.
~ 

59 PROTECT~ 

Syntax: protect <character> 

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping. Removing 
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character. 

NOTE: A no_snoop flag will show up in the stat <character> and will show
up in the 'channel' command of the receiver of the PROTECT command.
~ 

59 LOG~ 

Syntax: log <character>
log all 

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into the 
server's log file. Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle. Logs 
may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied by 
mail to the implementors. 

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  

Log all logs all character commands. It is a server-wide toggle; it does 
not persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps. 

** LOG FILES HAVE TO HAVE A REASON TO BE CREATED **
~ 

56 SNOOP~ 

Syntax: snoop - lists eveybody who you're snooping
snoop <charcter> - starts (or stops) snooping <character>
snoop self - stops snooping everybody 

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel. You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy. 

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops. 

NOTE: 56 are not allowed to snoop players that are in private rooms, only
57+ may do so, as they may be in a private room having cheap mud sex (or
expensive mud sex if one of the characters involved is role-playing a
hooker or stripper).
~ 

58 SET~ 

Syntax: Set skill <name> all 100 

Will set a charcter with all there skills to 100. This means a cleric will 
get backstab.

Blink lets you 'blink' out of existence, i.e., suddenly disappear from 
your current position and reappear elsewhere. You can only blink to

~ 

0 CURSE~ 

Syntax: cast 'curse' <character>
cast 'curse' <weapon> 

This spell reduces the character's to-hit roll and save versus spells. It

~ 

0 'DISPEL MAGIC' CANCELLATION~ 

Syntax: cast 'dispel magic' <character>
cast 'cancellation' <character> 

Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target. Dispel magic
has a reduced chance of working, and is considered an attack spell.
Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack. Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells. 

The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent 
spells (such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove. Not all spells
may be dispelled, notable examples being poison and plague. 

Being able to be canceled is an option that we allow. NOCAN will toggle
this option on or off. Check your 'auto' command for more details. 

(also see 'help nocan')
~ 

0 EARTHQUAKE~ 

Syntax: cast 'earthquake' 

Earthquake causes the ground itself to shake, causing people to fall to
the ground and be tossed around. Flying creatures are not affected, due
to the fact that they are not on the ground when the earthquake occurs.
However, using this spell causes the whole room to shake, and ALL beings
-- flying or nonflying -- will see this as an act of aggression, and
then attack the caster. (In other words, this is an area attack spell.)
~ 

0 'ENCHANT WEAPON'~ 

Syntax: cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon> 

This spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing its to-hit and to-dam
bonuses by one or two points. Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the
weapon grows more and more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or
destroyed by the magic. Also, every successful enchant increases the level
of the weapon by one...and there is no turning back.
~ 

0 'ENCHANT ARMOR'~ 

Syntax: cast 'enchant armor' <armor> 

The enchant armor spell imbues armor with powerful protective magic. It is

will become visible when they attack. It may also be cast on an object
to render the object invisible. 

The MASS INVIS spell makes all characters in the room invisible, including

This spell puts its victim to sleep. The amount of 'ticks' is dependant
on the level of the caster. You will remain asleep until either the

0 'SUMMON LORD'~ 

Syntax: cast 'summon lord' <name> 

Summon lord is an extremely powerful spell, allowing the caster to call
forth a demon lord from the netherworld. The downside, however, is that
it's EXTREMELY hard to control the summoned lord; worse yet, the lord
has a possibility to break the pentagram that holds him. 

There are six known demon lords in the realms. However, what their names
are remains a mystery, and can only be found through research...

this skill.
~

non-clanners. Fire and frost can break objects, and acid can damage armor. 

The number of breaths you can do depends on your character's hours. 

Each color dragon gets their own BREATH spell. EXAMPLE: A red dragon will 
get fire breath.

0 HATCHLING DRAGON~ 

These are our special addition to the mud, and are very powerful in their
own rights. When you choose the class Hatchling, you will be a small 
dragon without the ability to fly, and are vulnerable to certain weapon 
types. At level 10 a hatchling will turn into a random color dragon. When 
this happens, the player will receive more skills and spells that only 
their color may attain. 

Dragons are the largest of all the races, ranging from 9 to 12 feet in 
height. They are the most powerful of all the races, and are very durable. 
The ability to make them fly at any given moment as well as special spells 
make them rather hard to play, but are worth it in the long run. They 
receive many skills and spell which make their starting creation points 
(cps) seem rather minor. They take a serious player with a large amount of 
time and effort. 

Warning: With each color dragon there is a resistance spell and a 
vulnerable spell. A red dragon is vulnerable to frost, and is resistant to 
fire. The rest of the colors you must find out for yourself.

0 DWARF~ 

Dwarves are short, stock demi-humans. Known for there foul temper, glowing 
red eyes and great resistance to spells, they make a interesting character 
to play. Dwarves have a high strength and constitution. Their poor 
dexterity is well made up by their other resistances, such as disease and 
poison. 

(8 creation points)
~ 

0 HUMAN~ 

Humans are the most common race in this world, and make up the majority of 
the heroes. Although they have no special talents like the other races, 
they are more versatile then any other race, and are well-suited for all 
classes. They also get to train their primary stats higher then all others. 

(0 creation points)
~ 

0 ELF~ 

Elves are slightly taller then humans, but their body is much lighter, 
making them more nimble and thus harder to hit. Their lack of strength
and stamina are made up for by the ability to hide easily and their glowing
red eyes. Elves have a strong hold over the power of magic and mind, due to
their magical nature. Because of their excellent agility, they are 
difficult to bash. 

(8 creation points)
~ 

0 TROLL~ 

Trolls are a medium-sized, stocky race thought to have been dwarves
corrupted by the taint of chaos when the great magic first spread
throughout the land. They possess a surprising strength for their
average-shaped bodies, although they lack the strategic and long-range
planning abilities of the other races. As part of their transformation,
they have acquired an improved immune system, thus making them able to
heal faster with regeneration, along with a resistance to foul disease. As
a trade-off, however, fire disrupts their healing abilities. Trolls live 
in tribes, and while the tribes have differences in the way of beliefs and
customs, all tribes favor the axe as their totem weapon. 

(6 creation points)
~ 

0 GARGOYLE~ 

Gargoyles are a race of xenophobic, protective beings that hide away in
the mountains on Dominia. Thought to be an offshoot of the same species
that produced dragons, gargoyles are ferocious fighters, relying more on
their powers and size than sneaking up on their prey. Gargoyles have a
special kinship with the earth, as they can invoke the element to become
living stone warriors. These large, clumsy but wise beings have a
severe reliance on magic, giving them a weaker immune system than would be
expected for one of their kind. A gargoyle's favored tactic is to dive
from above on land-dwelling beings, slashing at them with long
polearm-like weapons that they so heavily favor. 

(12 creation points)
~ 

0 SLIVER~ 

Slivers are an insect like breed which likes to hunt in packs. Slivers are 
appoximatly the same physical size as humans, but their mandibles extend to
form long jagged arms that they flail at their opponents in hand to hand 
combat. 

(12 creation points) 

Slivers come with hand to hand naturally, and when reaching level 10, mature
into an adult sliver form. These forms give the sliver a specific ability 
to be shared with its fellow slivers when grouped. The sliver doesn't 
acquire its own ability, but acquires the ability of every other mature 
sliver in its group. A mature sliver can randomly 'trade' his ability for
for a different one at a trainer. The sliver abilities are as follows: 

Vorlath Sliver Affects mana by +25
Merlin Sliver Affects mana by +30
Magical Sliver Affects mana by +50
Samite Sliver Affects hit points by +25
Pain Sliver Affects hit points by +30

0 CLAN CLANS~ 

A clan is a collection of players, united to follow and further a common
cause. Each clan has rules and regulations that they must follow. These
rules are enforced by the leader - for the most part. If for some reason 
an immortal must interfere, that immortal must be a level 58+ or someone 
with a 58+ permission. 

To find out more about certain clans, and there beliefs, type 'help <clan 
name>'. This should list their purpose and reason for existing. There are 
five main clans that exist right now. They are JUSTICE, SEEKERS, KENSHI, 
VENARI, and KINDRED. There may be more clans if some mortal or immortal 
comes up with a reasonable idea and purpose. 

Joining a clan is a dangerous step for anyone. Many players (pkillers) are 
born to kill and torture other clanners. When in the pkilling system, you 
may kill anyone except for non-clanned characters. Switching from one clan 
to another is allowed. Remember that a clanner must have the received the 
leader's or recruiter's permission to join. 

Clan leaders are level 53, and recruiters are level 52. If you want your
spells to be a little more powerful, then get involved in your clan. 

In order for a clan mutiny to occur, one must contact a level 58+ for a
legal mutiny to happen. If not, the mutiny will be consider illegal and
non-official.  

IMPORTANT: You cannot join the pkill system if you didn't decide to at 
creation. 

(Also see 'help loner' 'help mutiny')
~ 

10 MUTINY~ 

In order for a clan mutiny to occur, one must contact a level 58+ for a
legal mutiny to happen. If not, the mutiny will be consider illegal and
non-official. The mutiny will follow these guidelines: 

1. The current leader has to accept. If not, then the leadership is then
given to the challenger, and the leader is then removed from the clan.
If there is more than one leader, then one memeber of the leadership
team must decide to face the challenge. 

2. The mutiny will occur at the earliest possible date that can be arranged
among the leader, the challenger, and a level 58+ IMM. (For example,
a fight will not be postponed to permit a character time to gain levels.) 

3. Once a mutiny has been declared all recruiting must be halted. The 
challenger can not be removed from clan or killed and looted or stolen
from by his/her clan mates.  Any clan mates who engage in such behavior
will be lonered.

4. If the challenger is a recruiter they will be allowed to retain their 
position and level. If the challenger kills or attacks a clan member 
he or she will be lonered and the mutiny will be called off (this does not 
include participating in duels with clanmates who agreed to the duel or 
killing a clanmate in an IMM run tourney). A challenger is expected to
continue to abide by the rules of the clan at the time of the mutiny.  If
they break clan rules will be put in 1212 until the mutiny is held.

5. If the current leader does accept the two will duel. If the challenger 
loses s/he will be deleted. If the the challenger wins then the leader
or leadership team will be lonered and the challenger will become leader. 

6. The leader may appoint someone from the clan to fight for her/him,
if the appointee agrees. If the challenger loses s/he must delete,
if the appointee loses the leader must leave the clan and the challenger
becomes leader. An appointee must have been a member of the clan at the
time when the mutiny was declared. 

7. A duel is a one-on-one fight, involving no wands, staffs, scrolls, 
potions, throwing objects, or pills (besides for spelling up before the 
fight). The only charmies allowed are troll arms/legs since the player 
can not control the making of those. The fight will be held in a safe room 
and the loser will get his/her corpse back. No looting will be allowed. 

8. No outside interference will be allowed during the mutiny (ie no one 
from outside the 2 person fight can cast voodoo on one of the fighting
players, etc.).  In addition, no one can be grouped with a player in a
mutiny fight. Anyone players engaged in such activity will be frozen or
punished in a similarly harsh manner.
 
9. Both the challenger and the leader will be cancelled prior to the fight
after this all spells have been removed, they will be restored and 
allowed to spell up with whatever means they have avalible, such as
potions and wands. They will NOT be allowed to worship before a fight.
Anyone in a mutiny fight caught with a worship spell on them will be
automatically disqualified.  Once they have spelled up, the players will 
be restored and the fight will commence. 

9. The fight must start within 10 seconds of the imm saying go. If you 
are the cause of the delay, you will be found in default, and judged the 
loser, lag is the only exception to this. No room affects may be in effect 
at the start of the fight. The fight may be stopped through the use of 
various of skills, however, it must be underway again in due time, which 
is no greater than 2 ticks. The imm will provide warnings before the person 
who stopped the fight is declaredthe loser. 

10. Anything not explicitly disallowed is allowed, any "questionable" things 
which have been forgotten here should be taken up with the immortal running 
the mutiny.  

11. Once a successful mutiny occurs, the new leader will have 24 hours to
make changes in clan membership. During this period another mutiny can
not be called.

0 PEEK~ 

Syntax: Peek <character> 

Peek is very similar to the ability of look, but with this skill you may 
look at someone's inventory. Only rogues can peek inside a person's 
containers. There is a slight chance that you may be caught when peeking at 
them. 
~ 

0 CHARTER FERRY~ 

Syntax: charter 

Getting to the other continent would be a hassle if it werent't for the 
ferries that run. You can charter the ferry for a small amount of gold.
When you charter, you are immediately transported onto the ferry, where
you will spend a few (game) hours, until you come to the next continent.
You must be at a ferrymaster in order to charter the ferry, and you have
to be at the ferrymaster at the correct times. See your local ferrymaster
for details.
~ 

0 LORE~ 

Syntax: lore <object> 

Lore is a separate skill from look. Sometimes you may wish to look at
items, and sometimes you may just want to lore it. Lore tells you a lot
of information about an object that looking at it does not reveal. This 
does the same thing as the identification spell, but costs no mana.
~ 

0 TOWN HOMES GUILDS TOWNHOMES~ 

Town homes are available to anyone. Only non-clanners may obtain a
private room in their home. A non-clanner's private room will allow only

Clan members (including loners) may also purchase a home. All rooms in
the clanner's home will be public rooms. 

The option of upgrading mana or hp regen rates is available only to
non-clanners. Before upgrading the hp or mana regen rates in a room, the
room must be private. Homes will all be _no mob_ (meaning you cannot 
bring or summon a mob into your home). Homes will not have a _no where_ 
flag. If you are home, people will know it. 

All town homes will be located in Stoneridge on the continent of Terra. 

Guilds may buy a 2-room vacation home in Shandalar (only after purchasing

0 Fellowship Guild~

At first there were two, a gigantic warrior and an elven conjurer. Itay was
the name of the warrior, as quick with his tounge as he is with his sword.
The elf was Karmon, an impatient conjurer who was known for his hot temper,
and deadly crushing hand.
 
They have roamed to lands of Terra and Dominia in search for adventure, but
monsters and princesses were not they only things they have found, they have
gained something more vaulable than gold and jewels, more important than
royal blood - They have gained friends.
 
The first one was Mooshi, a happy white dragon who loved nature, and with his
skills and magic could do wonderful things. The second was Karon, a second
conjurer who has studied the art of sorcery.
 
As time passes, many friends were gained, Itay has attained the rank of a Lord
that was given to him by Avacar himself, Valocar of Palankcaren. Karmon became
a Duke after he had given up his immortality, and gained much strength. The two
decided they must find a place to rest, both were tired and old, and wanted no
more than rest (and sexual pleasures, but that is not available on this land).
 
So the two have built up a mighty mansion and summoned all their friends.
They are now known as The Fellowship, a group of dedicated mates with no

leader. A team who is mighty for friendship, and not because of weapons.
The Mansion still has many rooms unoccupied, waiting for the new mates
to arrive and house it.
 
The Rules:
 
1) A member of the Fellowship is his own master. He may choose his own
   policy regarding helping any indevidual, and for which price - this
   is the not of the Fellowship's concerns should one decideds not to
   be helpful.
 
2) Rule 1 applies to members of the Fellowship themselves. One member
   is not required to help another. Help will usually be handed, as
   all members are friends and close ones.
 
3) In order to be accepted, one must be recognized by Either the Lord
   ord the Duke as a friend. Friendship does not start in a note, but
   in assistance and trust. Therefore no one can join the Fellowship
   instantly - it is a long and hard journy to be favored in the eyes
   of the Duke and Lord.
 
4) In order to be accepted, 5,000 gold are not enough. Maintence of the
   mansion is quite expensive, and so the fee is set by either the Duke
   or the Lord
 
5) If these rules seem very difficult, you are right ;)
 
The Lord and Duke.

Contact Mooshi or Karmon if you want to join this guild.

56 LAG~ 

Syntax: lag <character> 

This is a very interesting way of punishing those who disobey the laws of 
the Immortals. In essence their movements take twice the time as normal if 
they were to do any actions. For example: A spell takes twice as long to 
cast. This is especially effective for those who hate lag in general... 
which is just about everyone.

0 DOMINIA~ 

According to legend, Selina and Bosco were made from the same flesh. Bosco 
was given control of the Western half of the world and Selina ruled the 
Eastern half. A great body of water separated these lands and allowed Bosco
and Selina to develop their empires without interference. 

On Dominia Selina's power created a colony of man-like insects. These 
beings, which she named Slivers, paid homage to her and grew strong and 
prosperous. While on Terra, Bosco's generous nature spawned a race of 
dragons whose fierce and powerful skills refused to be contained. 

Eventually the dragon race learned of the Eastern continent and vowed to 
rule it. They invaded Dominia to ravage and destroy the inhabitants and 
gain power over the land. After many bloody victories, it appeared the 
dragons would dominate the lives of Selina's followers, killing those who 
would not obey their laws. 

Selina despaired, for she did not have enough power to defeat the dragon 
horde alone. It was then she was joined by Gargnath, a mighty troll wizard,
and Lawrygould, the King of Dominia. Together they constructed a great wall
around the coastal city of Shandalar from within which they could repel the
invaders.  

Guided by the wisdom of Gargnath and the intelligence of Lawrygould, Selina 
used her magic to unite the trolls and the slivers into a mighty army. 
Through great effort, such as few have ever seen before, the army of Dominia
routed the Dragon horde from their continent. They killed the most ruthless
and left only a small group of dragons to limp defeated back across the sea. 

The battle cost Selina much energy and weakened her substantially. She was 
laid to rest in a crypt only to be disturbed if Dominia was ever again 
threatened by the rule of Dragons. The trolls returned to their forest 
village and the slivers again prospered. The resulting peace lasted for 
decades. 

Unfortunately, efforts are now being made by many races to re-establish 
contact between the continents. King Lawrygould, fearing another invasion, 
hired the remains of the clan Pragmati to live on his shores and dedicate 
themselves to slaying Dragons. 

"Soon the Dragons will return, and if we are not prepared we will be at 
their mercy! Non-Dragons Unite! Throw off the chains of oppression! They 
are numerous and our strong are too few. We must focus our efforts on their
destruction, or face our own." -- King Lawrygould at the establishment of 
Clan Venari. 

Not all the inhabitants agree, however. Some feel that the reconnecting of 
the continents will be the long sought opportunity to make amends for 
ancient wrongs. These people, of both worlds, want trade and prosperity for
all.

0 APPRAISE~ 

Red dragons like nothing so much as treasure, and are notorious for
collecting huge hoards. With the appraise skill a red dragon can
increase the value of item at the risk of destroying it. 

Some items may not be able to be appraised. 

syntax: appraise <item>
~ 

0 DARKNESS~ 

Black dragons are able to use their magic to summon a cloud of total
darkness over a room. This darkness will overwhelm any known light
sources and even infravision will not help. Only creatures with dark
vision will be able to function normally within this cloud. All
creatures in the room will be stricken effectively blind as long as
they stay in the room. 

syntax: cast 'darkness'
~ 

0 LAIR~ 

Blue dragons are extremely self-reliant, rarely needing to visit the
confines of civilization. During their travels they may take up a
lair. The dragon may only have one lair at a time, but while within
their lair the blue dragon will be hard to find and enjoy a small
increase in the healing rate. 

syntax: lair
~ 

0 KARMA~ 

White dragons are extremely lucky creatures and are able to bestow this
luck upon others as well. The nature of this power is still not fully
understood, but white dragons will find they pay for raising the
luck of others with a piece their own strength. 

syntax: cast 'karma' <victim>

0 PYROTECHNICS~ 

This spell creates a burst of flame at the feet of the
victim, burning them severely. This spell is
especially painful to those who are weak to fire! 

syntax: cast 'pyrotechnics' <victim>
~ 

0 CLOUDKILL~ 

Green dragons are able to emit a highly caustic gas which can make a room
so toxic anyone who breathes it for long will suffer painful lung damage
and a nausea which inhibits their fighting skills. Long term exposure
brings with it a chance of being poisoned. 

syntax: cast 'cloudkill'

0 STORY~ 

In a simpler time, the citizens of Midgaard and the immortals of Valhalla
lived in peace under the benevolent rule of Bosco. A kind and fair leader,
he was beloved by all his subjects. During Bosco's reign he had 5 children,
each of them very different. First there was Taelisan, who was withdrawn, 
hard, cold and calculating; next was Carnas, who lusted for total control of
everything; then there was Bhaal, an indivdualist who sought his own path; 
next was Gabriel, who strove for goodness in all he did; the youngest was 
Chain, who sought to level all hierarchy. As Bosco grew old and weak, his 
children began to fight among themselves for the leadership of Terra. Not 
content to just wreak the heavens their squabbles, the children began to 
recruit mortals to back their claims. 

Eventually, the golden doors of Valhalla were forced open and chaos spilled 
across the region. Soon the streets of Midgaard were stained with blood. 
Using the last of his strength, Bosco stripped his children of most of their
powers and banished them and their followers from Midgaard. Those faithful 
mortals who had scorned the violence and refused to take sides mourned the 
loss of Bosco. These steadfast souls called on immortals from another realm
to restore order to their land. Answering the call came Delstar, Maclav, 
Daisy, and Gothic who pledged to uphold the ideals of Bosco and bring 
redemption to Terra. 

However, order was not easily restored and the first victim of the chaos was
the great immortal Gothic, who fell from the heavens and was lost to the 
world. The next to be claimed was Taelisan, who found himself tottering on 
the edge on insanity and surrounded by the memories of his dead father. He 
passed down leadership of Pragmati and retreated from the cares of the land.
Then the garden of Eden was surrounded by darkness and overthrown by the 
strength of a clan of Kindreds. Most recently, the clan of Eclipse fell by
the wayside because of weak leadership and a new clan by the name of Harpers
has arisen. 

A new danger now threatens the shores of Terra. A continent named Dominia
has been rediscovered across the Dragon Sea. Not only do the inhabitants of
Dominia scorn the name of Bosco, but they also despise his most favored 
race-- the dragon. They have recruited the remains of the Pragmati to live
on their land and repel any invaders.  

To be continued....
