themselves in your mind; all you can feel is pain, despair,
loneliness, deceit, and, above all, revenge.

Welcome to combat training.

The first lesson is knowing whom to fight.  Use the command 'CONSIDER' to
consider killing a monster.  Avoid fighting monsters that will kill you
easily.

The second lesson is running away.  There is a monster in the room down.
He is too strong for you to kill, but he won't kill you.  So go 'DOWN' from
here, then 'CONSIDER' him, then 'KILL' him.  After a while, type 'FLEE' to
escape from him.

You can also set your character to flee automatically with the 'WIMPY' command.
Type 'HELP WIMPY' to find out more about 'WIMPY'.

After you flee, you will be back in this room.  When you are ready to go on
to the next station, go 'WEST'.

Welcome to the cage room.  The adepts of mud school have captured some
monsters for you to kill.  In the four cages are four monsters of various
types.  Kill them all!

After you kill each monster, get all of the equipment from their corpses
with the command 'GET ALL CORPSE'.  You can then use the command 'WEAR ALL'
to wear your newly won equipment.

When you are done with the corpse, 'SACRIFICE CORPSE' to give it to your God.
God will reward you for this.

Between combat, you may need to rest or sleep to regenerate hit points.
You can 'REST' to regenerate hit points, or you can 'SLEEP'.  'SLEEP' will
refresh you faster than 'REST', but you will be less aware of your
surroundings.

Try: Gossip hello, I am a newbie.
 
2- OOC, short form of this is ']'
Try: OOC what does OOC stand for?
 
Try not to swear on the channels as it's considered rude and ignorant,
but if you have questions use these channels to find out what you need
as most players are helpful with newbies.

You have graduated from Mud School!  Take your diploma...if you can.
Go 'NORTH' from here to visit our arena.  There are plenty of low-level
monsters, but DON'T attack other players.

If you want to go directly back to the temple at any time, type 'RECALL'.

Don't forget to type save to protect your character.  You won't be saved after
quitting until you reach level 2, so also type save before you type quit.

If you need more help during the game, type 'HELP'.  If you see something
wrong or have comments, use 'BUG', 'IDEA', or 'TYPO' to report them.

May your visit here be ... mercenary.

The Center of the Dungeon~
You are in the center of a large room.  A faint light from above shows that
the floors are all covered with slime.  A feeling of dread comes over you as
you notice that this is NOT a great place to go.  Exits go in all directions.
Of special note is the one that brings you back up!!!

A Half-Constructed School~
You have just stepped into a large room, with implements of war all
around you.  Swords, axes, daggers, and maces line the walls.  Tomes of lore
and magical wands sit on tables all around, and you can see many people who
are ready to help you learn to use them.  First though, you must learn more
about yourself.  You may head to the west into Delstar's Training room to
determine where your personal strengths may lie and improve on them, and to
the east Maclav's Training Room is the perfect place to upgrade your skills.
 
In the room is a sign that you may read, to help teach you about
moving around this world effectively.

To find out your attributes, type 'score'.  You can improve your
attributes in Delstar's Training Room to the west.  You can practice your
skills and spells in Maclav's Guild Room to the east.  You can continue
through mud school by going north.
 
If you are a new character, you should go west first to improve
your hit points and stats. Then, come back here, and then go east to
improve your skills, especially your main weapon. Then, come back
and head north into the rest of the academy!

A Dark Tunnel~
You have entered a dark tunnel that is barely tall enough for you to
stand in.  It's very dark, so you need a light in order to see what is
around you.  If the dark frightens you, you can either return up, or recall
to leave this area.  There is, as always, a sign on the wall.

Remember that the 'RECALL' command can always be used to return you back
to the main city on either continent.  Redemption has two continents, which
are completely seperated from each other.  You can get from one to the other
by using the 'warp' station south and west from recall, by walking to the
breach by the sea, or using the spells portal or nexus.

An Abandoned Laboratory~
You have stepped into an old but recently-excavated room within the mud
school.  It appears that this room used to be used as a laboratory but
magicians who were trying to test out their new abilities.  Tables full of
notes and jars of strange substances line the walls.  Who knows what you
might be able to find here?  Surprisingly, a clean and clearly marked sign
is still hanging from the wall.

sign~
There are many magical items that let you cast spells you don't have, such
as wands, scrolls and staves.
Wands and staves have to be worn to be used, and can be used multiple times.
Scrolls can only be used once, but don't have to be worn.
Wands are used using "zap",
Staves are used using "brandish",
Scrolls are used using "recite <scrollname>".
Each of these items will work more frequently if you are better with the
appropriate skill, be it your skill in wands, staves or scrolls.
Type "skill" to see how good you currently are.
