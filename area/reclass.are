0 RECLASS CLASS REMORT~
syntax: reclass

Once you reach level 51 you may reclass your character to gain several
new abilities and also new restrictions.

This is the alternative to remorting. You may remort and reclass in any
order and choose to do one, the other, or both.

To reclass will require a specific number of quest points. You can find
out how many by type reclass once you are level 51.

Like remorting, reclassing will send your character back to level one.
It will remove all your equipment and put it in your inventory, and
reset all skills to 1% except the primary weapon for your class. Your
hours will be reset, your trains set to 3, and practices to 5. Any
skills which you gained prior to reclassing will be added to your
creation points, possibly raising your xp/level.

Each character class will be given the choice of two reclasses:

Warrior   -> Barbarian or Warlord
Ranger    -> Hermit or Bounty Hunter
Paladin   -> Cavalier or Templar
Thief     -> Assassin or Rogue
Cleric    -> Exorcist or Heretic
Druid     -> Hierophant or Herbalist
Mage      -> Wizard or Alchemist
Conjurer  -> Shaman or Sorceror
Enchanter -> Mystic or Illusionist
Invoker   -> Necromancer or Diviner

~
0 WARRIOR BARBARIAN~

Emotions and spirit guide the hand of every warrior. Barbarians are those
who have reached a deeper understanding of the primal self, using the
power of their emotions to unleash never before seen fury. This intense
physical focus has weakened the barbarian's understanding of magic. They
have developed a curious antipathy towards enchanted items which is so
strong they refuse to use any enchanted weapons.

Reclass skills:
Thicken: An increase in physical endurance enables greater capacity.
Martial Arts: Addition hand to hand training, including parry and stun.
Shield Bash: A violent counter attack to stun an opponent.

Cave In: Shower a room with rock and debris, damaging and blocking foes.
Rip: The ability to disarm any items held in hand, not just weapons.
Jump: A long distance leap across two rooms.
~

0 WARRIOR WARLORD~

The most experienced warriors may seek to dominate others and become
warlords. The warlord rarely fights alone. Ruling with an iron fist,
he leads others into battle more often than not. His training in tactics
and group combat have taken his emphasis away from one on one combat.
A single warlord on his own may find his own combat skills have 
diminished.

Reclass skills:
Thicken: An increase in physical endurance enables greater capacity.
Martial Arts: Addition hand to hand training, including parry and stun.
Dual Wield: Exchanging defense for offense, may use two weapons at once.
Push: The muscle to choose your own battleground.
Rally: Directing your followers directly to coordinate lethal assaults.
Leadership: Using tactics to enhance a group's effectiveness in combat.
Gladiator: Instructing another in the use of weapons.
~

0 RANGER HERMIT~

Most rangers walk a fine line between civilization and wilderness. There
are those who choose to completely withdraw from human contact and 
become hermits in order to perfect their skills. Hermits develop a
greater understanding of both nature and the abilities of their own
bodies. Following a strict discipline of solitude and abstinence, all
hermits are forbidden to group with more than one other player at a
time.

Reclass skills:
Thicken: An increase in physical endurance enables greater capacity.
Martial Arts: Addition hand to hand training, including parry and stun.
Shield Bash: A violent counter attack to stun an opponent.
Double Kick: While hasted, sometimes kick twice per round.
Carve Spear: Turn simple tree limbs into deadly weapons.
Iron Vigil: Survive for long periods without food or water.
Plant: Carefully tended gardens can yield surprising results.
~
0 RANGER BOUNTY HUNTER~

Among their training, all rangers learn the basics of tracking their
victims. Bounty hunters have turned the skill into a fine art. When
it comes to hunting prey, human or otherwise, it is hard to beat
a bounty hunter. All bounty hunters, as their names implies, are
consummate mercenaries. They are totally motivated by the gold that
awaits them should they slay their victims. A poor bounty will be
poor motivation for the kill, and the bounty hunter's combat skills
will suffer severely. On the other hand, a very high bounty will bring
out the finest in his skills. Additionally, bounty hunters may only
claim bounties, never place them.

Reclass skills:
Thicken: An increase in physical endurance enables greater capacity.
Iron Vigil: Survive for long periods without food or water.
Hunter ball: A mystical skill to see out of the eyes of your victim.
Dual Wield: Exchanging defense for offense, may use two weapons at once.
Call to Hunt: Summon a hound to track prey quickly.
Slide: The skill of chasing prey if they try to escape via magic gates.
Hunt: The ability to track attackers room by room.
~
0 PALADIN CAVALIER~

Most paladins come to realize a delicate balance between martial skills
and the powers of their faith. The cavalier is a knight who believes
in using combat skill to defend his beliefs. As a standard for honor,
this knight fearlessly charges into battle alone against fierce odds.
His bravery and skill have somewhat weakened his grip on magic, and
all cavaliers will find the strength of their spells weakened.

Reclass skills:
Thicken: An increase in physical endurance enables greater capacity.
Martial Arts: Addition hand to hand training, including parry and stun.
Shield Bash: A violent counter attack to stun an opponent.
Push: The muscle to choose your own battleground.
Jump: A long distance leap across two rooms.
Fortify: Putting faith to good use.
Charge: Dashing bravely into combat from a room away.
~
0 PALADIN TEMPLAR~

Guided by the power of their faith, templars are the domesticated
versions of paladins. Functioning primarily as temple guards, they
grow in faith and magical might under the training of the eldest
clerics. As a show of gratitude, all wandering templars are required
to tithe 10% of all income to the church. In addition, the strong
moral teachings of the templar forbid them from attacking people
far below their level, despite how much the individual may be wanted
by the law.

Reclass:
Thicken: An increase in physical endurance enables greater capacity.
Martial Arts: Addition hand to hand training, including parry and stun.
Missionary: The ability the bend the faith of others.
Sunray: A dazzling ray that will blind everyone in the room.
Summon Angel: Summons one holy angel to help the templar.
Faith: A little divine intervention with templar magic.
Silent Prayer: The art of discreetly using recall.
~
0 THIEF ASSASSIN~

Although the common thief sometimes serves as an assassin, those who
specialize in the art of killing are widely feared for their abilities,
even among other members of the criminal underground. The assassin is
an especially lethal breed of thief who sacrifices some of his
traditional training. Despite specializing in ambushes and surprise 
attacks, the assassin has lost some of his previous talents in sneak,
hide and stealing. His new skills more than make up the loss of
stealth.

Reclass skills:
Dual Wield: Exchanging defense for offense, may use two weapons at once.
Jump: A long distance leap across two rooms.
Slide: The skill of chasing prey if they try to escape via magic gates.
Push: The muscle to choose your own battleground.
Spy: Listening in on the other clans to help plan attacks.
Ensnare: Set various traps to incapacitate your victims.
Sap: A sneaky blow to the head to render foes unconscious.
~
0 THIEF ROGUE~

The rogue is a master at sleight of hand. Using a combination of magical
and optical illusions, the rogue astounds even the most perceptive
opponent. The rogue's skills lie in stealth and light fingeredness
rather than physical force, so rogues will find their backstabs much
weaker than before.

Reclass skills:
Tumbling: Advanced acrobatics to avoid various attacks.
Ensnare: Set various traps to incapacitate your victims.
Spy: Information gathering into the affairs of other clans.
Cheat: Improves chances at the casino. Don't get caught!
Steal Up: Advanced ability to steal directly from containers.
Peek Up: Advanced ability to peek directly into containers.
Oculary: A visual illusion which removes you from the sight
of most victims.
~
0 CLERIC HERETIC~

Not all clerics fall within the established hierarchy of faiths.
The few who choose to break tradition are branded as heretics by all
whom they meet. Weaving human sacrifices and other dark arts into the
expression of their faith, heretics reach out to the darker powers. No
heretic may follow the tenets of good, and must remain evil to invoke 
any of their dark powers.

Reclass skills:
Drain Life: Vile magic which taints the very soul.
Create Oil: The creation of explosive missile weapons.
Moonbeam: Channeling the powers of darkness into the undead.
Atheism: Undermining the faith of others.
Animate Dead: Raising the dead to do your bidding.

Withstand Death: The dark arts of cheating death.
Nightmares: Inciting a powerful curse onto others.
~
0 CLERIC EXORCIST~

Ever since the arts of magic revealed our world to creatures from
beyond, the planet has been plagued by many sorts of demons and
alien intelligences. The undead are among those whose misshapen
form goes against the very nature of our world. The exorcists are
powerful forces of good who fight to maintain the natural order.
They are dedicated to helping the common man recognize and fight
off these evils. They must remain seperate from that which they
battle, and remain good aligned in order to use any of their
powers.

Reclass skills:
Magic Stone: Using the might of mother earth to smite your foes.
Create Oil: The creation of explosive missile weapons.
Life Wave: A superior healing power which can restore the 
surrounding area.
Summon Angel: Calls upon one holy angel to fight by your side.
Turn Undead: A potent invocation which can completely eradicate undead.
Missionary: Your fervent beliefs can make others doubt their own.
Silent Prayer: The skill of discreetly praying to recall.
~
0 DRUID HIEROPHANT~

The eldest of the druids may attain the rank of hierophant. It is
said one cannot attain the status of hierophant in a single life-
time, and that those that do are the reincarnated spirits of animals
and trees. They may call upon the true spirits of mother nature
to create many unusual effects. As a follower of nature, all
hierophants must not stray from the path of neutrality. If they
break this restriction, nature will strip them of their hierophant
powers.

Reclass skills:
Winter Storm: Calling down a seasonal change to blanket an area.
Animate Tree: Summoning the eternal strength of the trees to aid you.
Whirlpool: Turn placid waters into a powerful vortex.
Earth to Mud: Liquify ground so it absorbs items and slows fleeing.

Wildfire: Potent magic to break the enchantment of equipment.
Elemental Protection: Guards against one random element.
~
0 DRUID HERBALIST~

Within nature there are an equal number of plants both beautiful
and lethal. The herbalist is a druid who has learned to control
these plants and live with them in perfect synthesis. He may call
upon their aid in many ways, and for him, only him, they listen
and obey willingly. As such, the herbalist will find his powers
weakened within the city or indoor areas. His focus is the great
outdoors.

Reclass skills:
Winter Storm: Calling down a seasonal change to blanket an area.
Animate Tree: Summoning the eternal strength of the trees to aid you.
Iron Vigil: Survive for long periods without food or water.
Plant: Carefully tended gardens can yield surprising results.
Elemental Protection: Guards against one random element.
Shock Wave: A focused vacuum that can blast people out of the room.
Tornado: Channeling the winds into a powerful vortex.
~
0 MAGE WIZARD~

Experienced mages must pass many trials before they can be
recognized as true wizards. The wizard adds several new powers
to this arsenal, including an enhanced understanding of imbuing
many items with magic, and the ability to bend the recall prayer
to their own needs. Wizards tend to be an arrogant lot, who use
their magic quite flamboyantly. They possess the knowledge of
so many spells that they insist on never needing to use the
same spell three times in a row.

Reclass skills:
Prismatic Sphere: A potent multi layered defensive spell.
Channel Energy: The abbility to channel raw magical energy at a target.
Sharpen: A quick enchantment to make weapons more deadly.
Wizards Eye: The power to glimpse into far away areas.
Beacon: Powerful enchantment to redirect the recall prayer.
Scribe: Copying down a magic spell onto scroll for later use.
Attraction: Insidious telekinetic magic to strip a victim.
~
0 MAGE ALCHEMIST~

In their journeys mages learn to deal with many unusual
substances. By studying the lost science of alchemy, the alchemist
can learn important skills in the creation and use of potions
and other liquids. Alchemists specialize mostly in the use
of non combat magics, preferring quiet study and experimentation
to direct conflict. As non-combat mages well trained in the use of 
potions and other magic items, alchemists will find it more difficult 
to use their spells in the high stress situations created by combat, 
making any spells use during a fight cost a small amount of extra mana.

Reclass skills:
Prismatic Sphere: A potent multi layered defensive spell.
Create Oil: The creation of explosive missile weapons.
Cryogenesis: Preserving gruesome trophies.
Embellish: Subtly increasing the enchantment on any magic item.
Replication: A one time copy of a potion can be made scientifically.
Combine Potion: Different brews may be fixed into one effective one.
Flesh Golem: Gruesome creature made from collected remains.
~
0 CONJURER SHAMAN~

The shaman is a conjurer who focuses on the magic of the spirit.
Beginning with the traditional effect of Spirit Linking, the
shaman is able to unleash several many new hexes which specifically
attack the very soul of their victims. This warping and reshaping
of linking magics reduces the shaman's abilities to use other
spells for transportation.

Reclass skills:
Combine Potion: Different brews may be fixed into one effective one.
Symbol: A sigil of warding which can protect your equipment.
Cryogenesis: Preserving gruesome trophies.
Repel: The ability to lock-down certain rooms against intrusion.
Jinx: A quick hex which can reduce the soul's resistance.
Flesh Golem: Gruesome creature made from collected remains.
Voodoo Doll: Creation of totems to torture victims from afar.
~
0 CONJURER SORCEROR~

The sorceror is an imposing figure. He literally crackles with the
raw magical energy that infuses his own being. The sorceror excels
in several unique and powerful spells which are able to both 
completely create and destroy victims with only a few words. The
sorceror commands fantastic powers, and he must be careful lest
they overwhelm him. Sorcerers who try to regain mana when they are
already at full will be horribly burned by the excess energy.

Reclass skills:
Combine Potion: Different brews may be fixed into one effective one.
Symbol: A sigil of warding which can protect your equipment.
Shock Wave: A focused vacuum that can blast people out of the room.
Scribe: Copying down a magic spell onto scroll for later use.

~
0 ENCHANTER MYSTIC~

The mystic focuses his attentions inward. Through the powers of
meditation the mystic learns to focus his magic in new directions.
All mystics gradually develop powerful psionic powers. The most
potent of these include the amazing telepathic power to steal spells
from the memory of victims, and also includes some telekinetic powers.
Mystics must meditate for several hours daily in order to maintain
the high mental fitness needed for their profession. A mystic who
does not keep up this restriction will find all his magical powers
gradually degrade.

Reclass skills:
Remove Align: Removes the alignment restrictions on equipment.
Flag: Enchant a weapon with a single weapon flag temporarily.
Abandon: Lock down rooms again transportation magic of all types.
Attraction: Insidious telekinetic magic to strip a victim.
Repel: The ability to lock-down certain rooms against intrusion.
Spell Stealing: Use the magical skills of another.
Jinx: A quick hex which can reduce the soul's resistance.
~
0 ENCHANTER ILLUSIONIST~

Although many magic users are trained in the use of simple
illusionary magic, the illusionist specializes in it to the exclusion
of all others. Many illusionists can seem slightly unhinged. Because
of the things they have seen, some begin to lose the distinction
between what is real and what is not. Due to the nature of their
specialization, illusionists begin to lose power on all of their
former enchantment spells to compensate for their new gifts.

Reclass skills:
Remove Align: Removes the alignment restrictions on equipment.
Flag: Enchant a weapon with a single weapon flag temporarily.
Jinx: A quick hex which can reduce the soul's resistance.
Duplicate: A copy of the caster which can fool attackers.

Oculary: A visual illusion which removes you from the sight
of most victims.
~
0 INVOKER NECROMANCER~

Many invokers deal with forces that would terrify other mortals on
a daily basis. None is more terrifying than those rare invokers
who choose to deal with the forces of entropy and death. The
necromancer learns magic which deals exclusively with the dead
and other denizens of the negative material plane. As part of this
contact, the path of good is forever closed to the true necromancer.
Any who stray from this path will be unable to use their necromantic
powers.

Reclass skills:
Meteor Swarm: A spell of massive destructive force and range.
Drain Life: Vile magic which taints the very soul.
Skeletal Warrior: Summons an aid from the negative material plane.
Animate Dead: Raising the dead to do your bidding.
Cryogenesis: Preserving gruesome trophies.
Withstand Death: The dark arts of cheating death.
Oculary: A visual illusion which removes you from the sight
of most victims.
~
0 INVOKER DIVINER~

Knowledge is power. All magic users accept this as simple truth.
The diviner might seem an odd line of training for the usually
flamboyant invoker, however many diviners would argue that their
knowledge and understanding makes them even more dangerous than
previously. Regardless, diviners will find their offensive magics
somewhat weakened by the transformation.

Reclass skills:
Meteor Swarm: A spell of massive destructive force and range.
Delayed Blast Fireball: An explosive magic that builds with time.
Inform: A quick glimpse into the powers of another.
Spy: Information gathering into the affairs of other clans.
True Sight: Powerful spell to see through any stealth.

Oculary: A visual illusion which removes you from the sight
of most victims.

~
0 SPECIALIZATION~
syntax: specialize <skill>

Any reclass may use this command to specify a single skill in 
which to specialize. The specialized skill may then attain
a rating of 130%. The additional 30% must be learned in the
normal method, and is not automatically granted. A reclass
may change specializations as often as desired, however,
changing your specializion will severely reduce the previous
skill.

At this time, only a few skills may be specialized. With time
others may become available.

The possible specializations are:
Dagger		Sword		Spear		Mace
Axe		Polearm		Whip		Flail
Hand to Hand	Parry		Dodge		Shield Block

This command is for reclasses only.

immediately.

in any room. The eye will stay where it is while the caster

in the surrounding area. The eye itself is feeble, and if 
spotted it may be killed easily.

unique.

Alchemist

0 COMBINE POTION~
combine <potion1> <potion2> |<potion 3>|

mage can successfully combine two or three potions into a single
vial. The mage must be holding an empty unused vial in their
hand when the skill is used. Not all brews can be combined
successfully, sometimes with explosive results. All three of
the potions being combined must be different.

This skill is for reclasses only.
Learned by:
Alchemist	Shaman		Sorceror
~
0 EMBELLISH~

This spell is a useful form of enchantment which can be used on
potions, scrolls, wands and staves. It will raise the spell
strength on any item by a random number of levels. Items can
only be embellished once due to the fragile nature of the
enchantment.

This skill is for reclasses only.
Learned by:
Alchemist
~
0 FLESH GOLEM~

Legends tell of insane mages who performed dark experiments in
seclusion, discovering the secret of life. Whether or not they
were entirely successful is not known, however, a side effect of
their research was the development of this gruesome and potent
spell. This spell requires the remains of up to a dozen victims.
The remains will then be combined and brought to life in the
form of a patchwork, sewn together, barely intelligent golem.
If the base requirement is exceeded, exceptional golems can be
created. These golems are empowered with the spirits of several
creatures, making them immensely tough.

This spell is for reclasses only.
Learned by:
Alchemist	Shaman
~
0 SYMBOL~

In their studies most mages come to be recognized by a specific
magical rune. Some mages are known to empower their rune with
specific spells. By using their magical symbol in this way, magic
users are able to protect their personal equipment from tampering.
If anyone but the caster of the symbol tries to touch the
equipment, they will be struck down by an offensive spell.

This spell is for reclasses only.
Learned by:
Shaman		Sorceror

using a doll as a direct link to the victim. This spell requires
a piece of flesh from the victim. Any severed body part will do.
The spell will change the body part into a doll which can be
saved indefinitely. At any time, someone may hold the doll in
their hand and cast spells through the doll at the victim. Only
direct offensive or defensive spells will work. The victim must
be online for this to work. Anyone may channel a spell through
a voodoo doll by typing "voodoo <spell>". Note that a specific

0 DUPLICATE DUPLICATION~

This spell is a powerful illusion which can take on enough aspects
of reality to make it very convincing. It creates a fake copy of the
caster in the room. The duplicate will look enough like the caster

little substance and can be shattered easily when located. The

a new one after a certain time has elapsed.

0 REMOVE ALIGNMENT~

0 FLAG~

After much training, enchanters have finally learned enough

wear off.

This spell is for reclasses only.

0 METEOR SWARM~

years until now. Summoning the very power of the stars, the 
caster summons several meteors which will crash into the 
surrounding area. The meteors will land at his location and
up to two rooms away in any direction. Each meteor will
rocket into the room and first cause impact damage to all
before exploding. The caster is far from immune to the meteors,
and is advised to save this spell as a last resort due to the
massive damage he may suffer.

This spell is for reclasses only.

0 ANIMATE DEAD~

infusing them with a shard of negative matter. The corpse will rise

existence follow his orders. The negative matter cannot function
for long on this plane of existence, and will evaporate into
nothingness after a time.

0 SKELETAL WARRIOR SUMMON SKELETON~

Only those truly dedicated to the forces of entropy can call upon
the aid of these hell spawned creatures. Doomed for all eternity
to inhabit the soul bleaching negative material plane, they will
arrive and quite eagerly inflict some of the pain that has been
dealt them in the last few millennia. As creatures not native to
this plane of existence, their time here is limited as the
negative matter which animates them rapidly decomposes in our
reality.

This spell is for reclasses only.

0 WITHSTAND DEATH~

This spell enables the caster to survive his own death. By
displacing his spirit at the moment of death and animating it
with a shard of negative energy, he can fool the reaper into
claiming the negative copy of himself before reanimating his
own body and rising to his feet. The painful transition will
only leave him with a small amount of stamina, and he must
certainly escape quickly!

to delay the spell that fails will cause it explode immediately,
harming everyone present, including the caster.

0 HAND TO HAND MARTIAL ARTS~

characters develop advanced skills in bare handed
fighting. The hand to hand skill of these
characters will automatically be upgraded to

the ability to do various type of hits rather
than simple punches, the chance to stun victims
with a lucky blow, and the art of parrying
weapons with their bare hands.

0 DUAL WIELD~

The epitome of weapon skills allows a character to
abandon use of his shield and held items in favour
of wielding a second weapon. It takes great skill
and dexterity to be able to fight with two weapons
without getting tangled up. While using two weapons
the character will attack more often, and will
alternate between weapons on each attack. This
technique offers several obvious advantages,
including greater ease of parrying, and the fact
that being disarmed will only remove a single
weapon. There are restrictions on each weapon
however. Neither weapon can be large enough to 
have ever required two hands, and certain classes
may only learn to dual wield certain weapon types.

This skill is for reclasses only.

his pupils will be no better with that skill than he.

0 SHIELD BASH~

Instead of learning to fight with two weapons, many
warriors learn to take more advantage of their shields,
using them not only to defend but also to knock opponents
off balance should they get too close. Any time a 
character successfully blocks with his shield he will
attempt to shield bash his attacker. Although most
shields do significantly less damage than any weapon,
the bash will stun the victim for a moment.

0 ENRAGE~

This is the legendary ability of barbarians to enter a
state of mind so bestial and inhuman that nothing may
survive their wrath. It may be combined with the berserk
skill, lowering the warrior's mind to that of a savage
beast. It is coupled with extreme disregard for ones own
life, and a decrease in the accuracy of all attacks at
the expense of savagery. The character's alien state of
mind also grants him some protection against magic.
