gath priest healer ~
Gath, the High Priest~
Gath, the High Priest and Healer of Shandalar greets you.
~
Gath seems very old and withered.  His white hair hangs to his shoulders,
although his beard is well trimmed.  Type 'heal' to see a listing of the
spell he knows.
 
Despite his apperance, Gath is well versed in the arts of healing.
You notice a sapphire ball floating near Gath, and ponder its mysteries.
It turns out Gath uses the "sapphire healing ball" to make his job
easier. You could fashion one for yourself as well. The healing ball
can cushion you from blows, and help you recover from wounds more
quickly as well. Crafting it, however, will not be simple. You need:
 
25 brilliant sapphires
a manual of healing arts
a bright ball of light
a quartz ball
a fragment ball
a basketball
a cue ball
 
Good luck!

The Dominian Receptionist is on an underdimensional call back to Palankcaren.
~
The Dominian Embassy, while small, does have a receptionist.  Unlike the
hustle and bustle of the Terran Embassy, the Dominian location is not well
suited to handle large volumes of dignitaries.  As such, the receptionist
often fills her free time by conversing with colleagues at other Embassies
or back in Palankcaren.  She also has found the time to keep a small
offering of concessions available for the Ambassadors and Guardians.  While
seated at her position behind the desk, she wears the standard uniform of a
Valocarian Assistant Abroad, with the emblem of the Valocar on a pin upon
her breast, and the long embroidered sleeves that demonstrate her
affiliation with the Monatar.

A middle aged man stands behind the bar.  When he sees you walk in, he
yells, "Leave your droids outside!  We don't serve their kind here."  His
squinty eyes, bulbous nose, and thick jowls, do not make him the most
welcoming looking man in the bar, but considering his clientele, he is more
than friendly enough for you.  "Try a death star."  He suggests.  In respose
to the quizzical expression you respond with he explains, "The Mos Eisley
Cantina is famous for it.  Bestdrink this side of the Hutts, and only twice
as dangerous.  It's made with a jigger of Guinness, Johnny Walker Blue,
mozzarella, a pinch of Copenhagen in one third Galliano, one third
Pinot Grigio, and one third Ancient Age, a raw oyster, a sprinkle of jerk
seasoning, a handful of gravel, a wee spritz of ginger ale, the dust of a
crushed number two pencil, tequila, Bantha juice, cranberry juice, some
salt, port, ranch dressing, a thimbleful of cider, a small hand-held
calculator, and a hibiscus bloom garnish with a Guinness and vodka chaser."

Looking closely you notice a small engraving on the bottom
of the replica. It reads simply,

You utter the word out loud, unsure of what it means...
 
When suddenly the eyes of the replica glow with pinpoints
of red light! A hissing insectoid void buzzes in your head:
 
"Scattered and trapped forever by the dragons of Bosco,

The stoney pathway to the Outpost~
You happen onto a huge stone path, twisting towards the skeletal remains
of a huge dragon-like beast.  The mouth of the skull opens like a cavern
door, and black canvas covers the ribs to keep out weather and pestilence. 
Enter the foreign outpost of The Traveller's Rest for a tasteful brew.  To
the east the inner beast awaits.

Ivory coloured benches of polished bone gleam with surreal cleanliness. 
Michievious deviants from all Dominian races laugh and cheer as they gather
at this lone outpost, admiring the bone structure arching over their heads. 
The crowded bar serves out mugs of cold drinks.  To the east lies a stone
path, north is the causeway and there is a small wooden trap door lying open
that leads down.

You are standing inside the beutiful and huge PlayBunny Mansion.  This is
the waiting room where you find out if you are accepted into the "special"

a huge statue of a Bunny.  The floor is made of marble and you cannot even
see the ceiling as it is so high!  Let's hope you make it past the doors! 
To the south are the noisy streets of Shandalar.  The only other exit is
east, further into the Bunny guild.

You stand before an ordinary house, common to Dominia's shore.  Even more
common is the door, just solid wood painted green.  And still, is a window,
as common as wars on these shores.  Yet, behind its common curtains you can
occasionally see a not so ordinary, not so common, completely abnormal
figure of a snake-headed woman, peering with greedy ambition upon the city. 
The streets of Shandalar can be heard from the north.  The guild hallway
extends southward.

A warm den and a cozy fire~
You stand inside a warm den, made so by a hovering fireball in the center
of the room.  Around the windows, vines are in bloom; their flowers
gathering any light possible.  Large, comfortable pillows lie scattered
about the floor and beneath the flame is a round wooden table with three
chairs.  Upon the table is a ceramic pitcher.  In a southern corner is a
spiraling metal staircase leading to the upper room.

The upper room~
There is a single window on the northern wall of this room.  Outside you
can always see Cuervo, faithful to his duties.  Most fascinating is the
constant warfare seen in the steets, as you will often see a tattered
clanner fleeing for his life from a horde of enemies.  Inside the air is
still.  The southern side of the room is cloaked in shadows.  The only exits
lies downward.

Steamy Hot Rabbit-Made Waterfall~
The heat and steam overwhelms you.  Through the thick foggy steam you can
barely see your hand in front of you.  What's going on further in?  The
water rushes loudly, you hear a faint giggle in the distance.  You never
want to leave....  And why would you?  The only visible exit is to the
south, towards a comfy bedroom.

Secret Entrance~
This appears to be another entrance into the Traveller's Rest bar and
from the looks of it very few people know it exists.  Rusted metal rungs
protrude from dust caked walls providing access to a trap door, definitely
not as well maintained as the interior bar.  The room is very dark and who
knows what kind of creepy crawlies are around.  The way into the bar is
found up, down is Liberty Lane.

Away from the crowded bar is this round room of dark red walls and soft
plush red carpeted floors.  There is no light, except for the portals
glowing their eerie aura.  It's very quiet in here.  The only noise is the
pulsing of the walls.  The Belly of the Beast lies down, while a sign leads
the way to new journeys in other directions.

You are standing in a small but well-kept shrine.  There are few
adornments except for those near the center of the shrine, where a large and
pristine statue of Selina stands.  The statue is made of pure gold, and is
guarded and tended daily by one of Selina's most faithful acolytes.  This
acolyte stands before you, and asks to you step closer for a personal
conversation.

You are standing before the Temple of Shandalar-- a truly majestic
structure constructed from pure marble.  Tall Corinthina columns flanks an
impressive set of bronze-bound oaken doors, which are never shut save in
times of war.  Atop the temple's pillars rests a plinth bearing an
incredibly well-crafted frieze which depicts the goddess Selina at work
creating the World.  A long series of marble stairs lead up to the 'College
of Shandalar'.  A shorter set of steps lead down into Shandalar's famed
Chamber of Donations.  To the east and west runs a broad, tree-lined avenue
called 'Victory Parade'.  To the south is 'Glory Avenue'.

accumulate.  There are shelves, bins, chests and cupboards all filled with
various articles of equipment.  Anyone is free to come here and take what
they will, but Selina frowns on greedy characters who take it all, 
or profiteers who take it and sell it.  Both offenses result in SEVERE
punishment.  There is a small sign here.

Welcome to combat training.

The first lesson is knowing whom to fight.  Use the command 'CONSIDER' to
consider killing a monster.  Avoid fighting monsters that will kill you
easily.

The second lesson is running away.  There is a monster in the room down.
He is too strong for you to kill, but he won't kill you.  So go 'DOWN' from
here, then 'CONSIDER' him, then 'KILL' him.  After a while, type 'FLEE' to
escape from him.

You can also set your character to flee automatically with the 'WIMPY' command.
Type 'HELP WIMPY' to find out more about 'WIMPY'.

After you flee, you will be back in this room.  When you are ready to go on
to the next station, go 'WEST'.

Welcome to the lobby.  The adepts of Shandalar College have captured some
professors for you to kill.  In the four classrooms are four teachers of 
various types.  Kill them all!
 
After you kill each teacher, get all of the equipment from their corpses
with the command 'GET ALL CORPSE'.  You can then use the command 'WEAR ALL'
to wear your newly won equipment.
 
When you are done with the corpse, 'SACRIFICE CORPSE' to give it to your God.
God will reward you for this.
 
Between combat, you may need to rest or sleep to regenerate hit points.
You can 'REST' to regenerate hit points, or you can 'SLEEP'.  'SLEEP' will
refresh you faster than 'REST', but you will be less aware of your
surroundings.

There are channels here on Redemption to learn about.  The main ones
are as the following:
 
1- Gossip, short form for gossip is '.'
Try: Gossip hello, I am a newbie.
 
2- OOC, short form of this is ']'
Try: OOC what does OOC stand for?
 
Try not to swear on the channels as it's considered rude and ignorant,

North of you is a dark room.  I hope you still have the lantern!  If not,
you have to back to the store and buy one.

In the room is a monster with a key that you need.  After killing the
monster and getting the key, come back here, UNLOCK EAST, OPEN EAST,
and continue east.

Graduation!~
This is a very bright room, with a marble pedestal in the center.  Behind
the pedestal stands a person cloaked in Silver.  Tapestries flow from every
wall, and you feel very happy to be here right now.  There is a big sign here.
The only exit is on the other side of the gate east of you.

sign~
You have graduated from  School!  Take your diploma...if you can.
Go 'EAST' from here to visit our arena.  There are plenty of low-level
monsters, but DON'T attack other players.

If you want to go directly back to the temple at any time, type 'RECALL'.

Don't forget to type save to protect your character.  You won't be saved after
quitting until you reach level 2, so also type save before you type quit.

If you need more help during the game, type 'HELP'.  If you see something
wrong or have comments, use 'BUG', 'IDEA', or 'TYPO' to report them.

May your visit here be ... mercenary.

A Rift in {MSpace{X and {BTime{x~
You have entered a Palankcarian rift.  Unlike the Great Portal located at
the top of the Tower of Power on the Terran Embassy, this is not, on its
own, a portal back to Palankcaren.  Instead, this rift simply folds space
and time in on itself and causes two points to be coincident; effectively
allowing the Palankcarians of the Dominian Embassy to occupy the same space
as the Great Portal while in the rift, allowing them to transport around as
if in a portal.  Through wavy distortions in space-time you can make out,
through a collage of colour a number of different destinations; below you,
it almost seems to be the Terran Embassy, while to the North, you see
vaguely make out the darkness that could be the hidden room in the Dominian
Embassy.  In the other directions, things are less clear, however as you
drift towards them, you feel yourself drawn inwards, as if imploding into
pure energy.  In all this madness, your eyes are drawn to the only
stationary object, a small glowing sign in the middle of the Rift.

Inside the Chippy~
You have entered the local chippy. Your nostrils are almsot immediately
assailed by a pleasant aroma- it's amazing how good hot fat smells, isn't
it? You see a portly Italian standing behind a large glass counter full of
fried food. It certainly smells a lot better than it looks. A customer
standing next to you says- "It looks a lot better than it tastes...". Most
of the food has probably been sitting under those hot lights for a couple
of hours. The only thing you can be reasonably sure of is the chips.
By the way, EVERYTHING is fried.

of famous dragons throughout time are here, as well as intelligence
on anti-dragon movements such as Venari posted on the wall.  On a
small table in the centre of the room are attack plans for Dominia,
interesting embassy.
