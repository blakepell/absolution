Rufus, the Captain of the Shandalar Knights~
Rufus, the Captain of the Shandalar Knights, stands here guarding the west entrance.
~
Rufus is a tall, barrel-chested figure well known in the city of
Shandalar for his strict pursuit of the law.  Thus far, he's here to guard
the western broken section of wall from people who really shouldn't be
wandering down this way.

a filthy, skulking troglodyte~
A lizard-like troglodyte is here, glaring.
~
A troglodyte is a tall, man-like lizard with barely enough intelligence
to use weapons and wear vague sorts of armor.  They tend to gather
underground where there's plenty of garbage to eat, and stink to high hell.

A huge, two-headed giant squats here, blocking the tunnel.

It's a variety of giant-kind known as an ettin: a twoheaded breed that
are notoriously stupid, even for the normally obtuse giant species.  They
often tend to just sit in one spot and not move unless forced to move or
they run out of food.

dwarves have.  His long hair is completely white with age, though his beard
and moustache are neatly combed.  He's dressed in ancient-looking armor,
scarred and tattered with age and constant fighting.  Kurnus also reeks of
Dwarven booze.

Selina's High Priest, Willim the Grey~
An old man in long, flowing robes stands here serenely.
~
The old man is, well, old.  His hair is long and white, trailing in the
faint breeze of the Shrine.  His robes are of utter white as well,
unwrinkled even considering his age.  Perhaps the man's not even alive at
all, but a mere enchantment like the rest of the Vault.

This large, nasty-looking axe swings from side to side in the passage

it, others have tried to go past and failed.  Perhaps if you were hasted you

Blurgindal, the gnome sage~
An old, wizened gnome is here, wandering about the Vault corridors.

The sage is a terribly old, wrinkled gnome with a small pair of
spectacles perched on his long nose.  He wears a pair of dirty pants and a
worn leather jerkin, and carries an enormous book.  Perhaps if you {ggave{x
him something, he would give you some information about it.  He only knows
the history of items from the Vault, however.

Jinna, the Elf Ranger~
A grungy female elf is here, calmly skinning a dead troglodyte.
~
She doesn't look particularly old, but judging by the scars upon her
she's been down here for quite a long time.  Her leather armor is dirty, her
weapons mildly rusted, but her hunter's knife is sharp and gleaming.  If you
gave her a pelt, no doubt she could make something grand out of it.

pieces of old chicken.  He's carrying around a wooden horse he must have
found in the garbage, and wears a ragged, torn top hat.  The smell coming

blueprint echo bell~
The blueprint is pretty straightforward, written in the
srawling script of the gnomes.
 
----------------------------------------------------------
The echo bell is a very useful tool. With help from the
dwarves, we've discovered that with the bell we can
detect sizeable rock formations through solid earth,
and can ring it much louder to carve tunnels into the
ground, or knock down your neighbour's house. Fun!
 
The only way to make it (that we know of!) is to take
ten sheets of steel and combine them with this very
blueprint. Then you can make the "gnomish echo bell"!

blue crystal pillar dominian kingsword~
The Kingsword is a tall, sleek-looking weapon with a hilt covered in
jewels and gems.  It hums faintly in the air, as if anxious to leave this
resting place.  However, taking it is certainly not as easy as merely
plucking it from the pillar.

A Rocky Ledge~
The ledge is large and can, thankfully, support a great deal of weight. 
It's not yet near the top of the cliff itself, however, but merely a
resting-place carved into the sheer rock of the enormous vertical tunnel. 
Carvings of various scenes are marked into the walls in various places -
battles between armies, wizards casting great magics, great cities crumbling
and falling into the ocean.  A new set of stairs heads up higher through the
tunnel.

Up the Stairs~
The stairs continue to head slowly upwards out of the tunnel.  It's very
difficult to maneuver through the staircase itself, since the steps aren't
terribly wide and there is no railing to speak of.  Also, a low, deep
humming of wind occasionally threatens to drag travellers back down to the
bottom of the tunnel itself.

Up the Stairs~
Near the top!  The staircase begins here, trailing in a loop around the
outer wall of the enormous vertical tunnel.  It's so wide that it's nearly
impossible to even see the other end of the gorge, and the curve is barely
noticeable when one is travelling upon the steps.

Selina's Shrine~
The Shrine is a simple, octagonal gazebo with a thick, stout wooden roof.
Eight sturdy marble pillars surround the shrine, forming a sort of barrier
to the outside world.  And what a world it is!  There is nothing, as far as
the eye can see, except rolling clouds surrounding and blue skies above. 
It's as if the entire Shrine is floating miles above the land!  The clouds
form a dense valley below as well, blocking sight of the land.  The wind
rustles mildly, smelling faintly of roses.  It is a calm, quiet spot,
perfect for relaxing and resting.

Shandalar Cemetery~
The old Shandalar Cemetery is a grim and featureless expanse of fields
and gravestones.  Largely unnoticed by the populace at large, the gates were
only recently opened to the public after many years of renovations.  A worn
dirt path meanders through the rolling hills, up towards a much larger,
somewhat imposing stone crypt, to the north.

Inside the Crypt~
The dank, dingy crypt is cramped tightly with old, dusty coffins and
cairns.  Definately not a place to remain for long.  The musty scent of mold
and mildew permeates the room, the floor a crumbled marble tile.  The names
on the tombs and crypts seem to have all been smudged out over time -
obviously whoever's been interred here have layed in peace for aeons.  To
the west, however, is a gaping hole in the rock wall.  Interesting.

Rubble-Strewn Chamber~
The bodies stuck into the wall alcoves here seem much further apart, as
if the builders and diggers were loathe to proceed any further then they had
do, down here in the murk and gloom.  Odd noises come from the shadows, and
faint trails of some creature is left in the dust.  At the far corner of the
room appears to be a hole, as if a great rent were merely torn directly into
the floor.

The catacombs here trail into plain underground tunnels, with little to
no sign of previous civilized habitation.  In fact, they now appear to crawl
with various odd subterranean animals, some of which no doubt want to eat
such a warm-blooded creature like yourself for breakfast.  Southwards the
tunnel continues, though the dirt appears to change to mostly buried natural
rock.

Before the Vault~
The catacomb tunnel abruptly ends here, and rather than the ordinary
blank stone of the catacomb walls, the floor, ceiling, and walls meld into a
form of odd steel, all coming together in the shape of a massive doorway. 
The door itself looks ancient - writing along the outer rim is completely
undecipherable from age.  However, it still looks to be in good enough
repair to enter.  There is, however, one legible sign pasted to the front:

Above the Stairs~
A metal catwalk winds down into the darkness, though various dark and
disturbing shapes are eventually revealed to you by the flickering light of
torches.  A massive, darkness-shrouded hall opens up somewhere far below, so
far that it's impossible to see the walls or ceiling, just the metallic,
grated floor.  A somewhat musty scent wafts through, and there is the sound
of restless moving, of chittering, of odd voices echoing from the gloom. 
Eerie.

Eerie remnants of the past lie here in piles of refuse.  A huge, rusty
pile of metal beams lays against the far wall, scattering the light into
gleaming reflections.  Crates and boxes lay sprawled in the corners of the
room as well, and odd underground creatures peer at from around them.  Cold
white eyes stare from various darkened corners.  A sense of malevolence
permeates the Vault; a definite feeling that strangers are not welcome.

Entrance to Guard Barracks~
A narrow tunnel heads both north and south, though it appears that it
doesn't remain as a tunnel for long.  The sound of restless movement echoes
easily from the north, though it's far too dark to detect what, precisely,
might be lurking there.  This place must have been sealed for a tremendously
long time, however - the few items of interest are worn down to nothing.

This was, rather obviously, a guardhouse for the earliest protectors of
the Vault.  On the west side of the large, rectangular chamber is a number
of ancient-looking beds, most of them beyond all possible recognition.  A
number of guard stations are placed about the massive chamber, likely in
case of attacks so they could defend it easily.  The rest of the room has
deteriorated far too much to be recognizable.

Guard Barracks~
On this west side of the chamber appears to be the living quarters of the
old Vault guards - though now, it is home to a number of large, ugly
troglodytes.  Their nests and lairs are so hidden, it might be impossible to
clear the entire place for very long before they just come back again. 
Definately not a pleasant place to live, unless you're a troglodyte.

The central western section of the guard chamber is largely empty, save
for the combined refuse of hundreds of years of troglodyte owners.  Whatever
remained of the guard's furniture has mainly gone to the creation of the
troglodyte's nests and weapons.  Judging by the amount of insects scuttling
about, they even have plenty to eat.

The corner section of the guard barracks is much like the rest of it. 
The blank stone walls are bare of all ornaments, and the only light shining
in the gloom comes from the illumination of subterranean insects.  The
troglodytes have trashed this place beyond all recognition and it's been
long since looted of anything of value, unfortunately.

Smooth Passageway~
The great hall here narrows quickly, down into a barely lit hallway.  The
walls are a dusty, smudged brown, the metal grating of the floor trailing
off into a strange off-white tile.  The sounds of the creatures spawned here
grows louder, the further one goes.  However, it most certainly does appear
man-made and not a natural tunnel - the walls, ceiling and floor are
perfectly square and very smooth to the touch, when slime or mold isn't in
the way, that is.

An enormous iron staircase abruptly appears down the smooth tunnel,
slowly curving its way up a massive hole in the stone ceiling.  There is
very little light to illuminate the path upwards, and thus the tunnel in
that direction is perfectly dark.  The sounds of the Vault's occupants
echoes into one eerie, continues background noise.  Unpleasant, to say the
least.

While the iron staircase heads down into the darkness, a much more
impressive sight is to the north.  Past a frightfully short stone ledge, the
rock simply..  ends.  An enormous tunnel heading straight up and down
appears to simply carve straight through the earth.  It is so staggeringly
huge that no light can pierce all the way to the opposite side.  A narrow
pathway leads, however, around the outer rim of it.

The eastern stone ledge leads towards another fissure in the rock, though

to lead to a wide, arching stone bridge without guard rails or even supports
beneath it.  Beyond the edge is only empty air; it's impossible to tell how
deep the thing is.  Best not to fall off.

Strange.  The stone tunnel here ends, the smooth slope travelling back up
towards the stone bridge.  That, however, isn't what's strange; the rock
wall, instead of continuing to be ordinary rock, seems to meld into a form
of coral, or shell - very similar, in fact, to a snail's shell, only much,
much harder.  The tunnel spirals around in a circle, starting to the north.

Travelling the Spire~
The coral-like rock of the spire is omnipresent.  Even the floor and the
ceiling are made of the same blank whitish material that glows slightly in
any sort of light.  It's oddly like travelling through a snail's shell. 
There doesn't appear to be much of interest down the entire spiral except
for whatever strange creatures live here.  The faint sound of running water
echoes from somewhere down below.

Stairs before the Waterfall~
The coral rock of the spiral tunnel ends abruptly here, fading once more
into blank grey rock.  However, from a grate above this small chamber comes
a torrent of murky brown water, sloshing through in an endless stream
through the rested metal bars.  It pours down just in front of a spiralling
metal staircase that travels downwards.  Doesn't look particularly safe,
however.

The roaring water pours forth from the tunnel roof far above,

should have rusted straight through many years before now.  The staircase

Underground River~
This is where all that water's gone, it would seem.  To the north lies a
massive underwater river travelling east and west, occasionally rising
higher than the ceiling and sloshing over the stone ledge that overlooks it.
Certainly not a pleasant thing to travel within unless you can breathe in
water.  The current looks very strong, too.  Otherwise, the only other path
leads back up the metal stairs.

as well, nibbled on by a variety of carnivorous underwater life.  The river
heads constantly to the east, though there doesn't seem to be an ending

Aha!  A small side-tunnel is here, draining out the water from the

the passageway is fairly damp, but still easy to navigate down.  The slope
heads downwards into darkness, and upwards if anyone has the urge to dive
back into the river.

Fork in the Road~
Deeper down in the Vault, this place seems to be somewhat more man-made
and kept in better condition than the rest of it.  For the large part,
globes of continual light are placed in containers on the ceilings and
walls, illuminating the grey stone walls and casting deep shadows over what
tangled remains of furniture still stand.  Large piles of rubbish and rubble
lay scattered here and there.  The stream of water from above drains into a
grate in the floor, though the passage itself splits to the north and south.
The north seems much darker than the south passage.

Darkness permeates this stone corridor, though judging by the tiles that

of glowing letters are interspersed on the doorway itself, as well as around
its outer edge.  Warning signs, perhaps?

Artifacts Storage~
Shelves and crates are stacked up in every direction, as far as the eye
can see.  This, no doubt, was one of the main storage chambers of the Vault
itself.  Massive heaps of garbage are piled every which way without any
order at all.  Most of the items have long since rotted away, though easily
discernable in the rubble are a half dozen or so huge, hulking stone statues
standing silent vigil over the belongings.

The pale grey stone of the chamber's walls is nowhere near as slime and
moss-covered as the rest of the caverns previous to this one.  The storage
chamber heads both east and south.

this junk is a cleared section down the very center.  To the north, however,
the passage ends in another large, ironbound doorway.  This one has a great
deal of glowing runes scribed all over it.  Even though the script is almost
archaic, it's clear that they are meant to be a warning not to pass beyond.

The musty scent of old books fills this long, narrow chamber.  Some form

books and tomes are in a fairly good state for being down here such a
tremendously long time.  They are piled about with no discernable order in
the slightest.  The chamber continues north, and the massive door that
seperates it from the artifact chambers is to the south.

Unlike the hallways to the east, this curve in the tunnels is in a bad
state of repair.  The lights floating near the ceiling flicker on and off,
as if the magic giving them life has started to fade over the centuries. 
The hallway itself curves from east to south, and to the south there is more
of those strange flickering lights.  How odd.

There's no doubt that this must have been a gnomish workshop, since most
of it appears to have been blown up repeatedly during the time it was in

there are a few usable items hidden in the rubble.

Dwarven Forge~
The heat in here is oppressive.  Like a solid wave, the temperature
stifles any sort of movement within the small, circular chamber.  It appears
to be coming from some active machinery on the far side of the room -- a
massive iron forge that dominates the far wall.  Rolling flames lick out
from the opened hatch in the front, though any other items that were
supposed to go inside are long since rusted away.  It's only due to the
incredible skill of the dwarves that this one machine is even still active. 
Perhaps if you "gave" something to the forge it would melt it down for you.

different styles, and in a cracked, empty jar on a workbench there is the
dried-up old husk of a sliver brain.  How pleasant.  On a pillar in the

the enormous rock walls that are at an even height the entire way.  The
floor is relatively flat, though a thick layer of dust covers the surface
from wall to wall.  There is a lingering echo from somewhere to the south,
an odd, high-pitched buzzing noise.  Strange.

The long book-filled chamber continues for a distance here, though the
rear wall eventually proves that the place is, indeed, a dead end.  Enough
light shines in from the various magical globes of light attached to the
ceiling to show that it, unlike most of the other chambers, is not in
disarray.  The stacks of books here are neat and tidy, with numerous scroll
cases piled in pyramids along the main pathway.  At the far end of the
chamber sits something rather interesting indeed: on a short marble stage
stands a carved stone statue.

Hole in the Floor~
The broken tunnel heads down deeper into the earth.  The stone walls here
are badly carved - perhaps whoever made it merely widened a smaller fissure
in the stone.  Nevertheless, the gloomy passageway heads only downwards -
it's impossible to climb back up out of it at this point and the rocks are
too jagged to fly past safely.

The pathway drops down in a winding arc, looping so that it eventually
straightens again in an unnaturally even level.  Thus, it's no doubt
man-made.  To the north, however, is a massive set of double iron doors. 
While one of them is lying on the stone floor of the passage and is covered
in dust, the second stands firmly upright.  Half of a glowing magic rune is
visible on that door - a warning of danger to anyone who dares pass this
way.

The long stone passageway is, unlike most of the rest of the Vault,

It's not necessarily a good thing, however; the light illuminates twin rows
of carved stone statues that block the passageway to the north, their
halberds crossed over each other.  A single stone statue, dressed in an
archaic, ancient set of metal armor, stands in the center of the passage
with hands clasped to a gleaming still sword.

same; the figure also wears a glowing, gleaming silver amulet in the symbol
of Selina around his blank stone neck.

The lights abruptly stop shining on this room - the globes of light do

of skulking about.  His dagger gleams with an inner, reddish fire, vaguely
illuminating the dozens of other similar statues blocking the way to the
north.

This time, they are a facsimile of mages - long robes are carved onto them,
and each one carries either a staff or a small stone dagger.  They block the
passage as firmly as the other statues did, though.  The one in the center
carries a large iron staff, inlaid with a slightly glowing sapphire on the
top.

Golden Staircase~
Finally, the passageway begins to narrow and finally comes to a halt. 
The light, instead of falling upon more statues, illuminates an incredible
sight - a massive spiral staircase that heads down through the floor to a
lower level.  It's not the staircase itself that's so incredible, but what
it's made of; for the light gleams a bright golden hue when reflecting off
of it.  A staircase made of gold?  Seems fairly extravagant.

When the golden staircase ends, it leads to a short metal ramp and
another short tunnel.  This one has the requisite warning signs that most of
the other tunnels in the Vault have had; though a number of large and
angry-looking skulls have been scribed on the walls of this one.  Not a
particularly good sign.  The faint, musty smell of death permeates this

Guardian Crypt~
The ancient crypt is dark and malevolent; whoever rests here obviously
don't like intruders.  Twisting, spiralling runes travel here and there over
the walls as if alive.  To the east and west are two clouded, darkened
archways heading to smaller tombs.  A number of stalwart stone statues guard
the corners of the room, but thankfully they don't appear to be in any hurry
to come to life and attack any tomb looters.  The residents of the tombs
might be a different matter.

A Tomb~
The scent of death and decay are omnipresent in this small, concealed
tomb.  It's a simple square chamber carved out of the rock, with an elevated
platform in the center for holding a stone coffin off the ground.  No
natural light infiltrates this resting place, though judging by the
scuttling sounds, the insects don't seem to be bothered by the lack of
illlumination.

Inside the Crypt~
The ancient crypt is dark and malevolent; whoever rests here obviously
don't like intruders.  Twisting, spiralling runes travel here and there over
the walls as if alive.  To the east and west are two clouded, darkened
archways heading to smaller tombs.  A number of stalwart stone statues guard
the corners of the room, but thankfully they don't appear to be in any hurry
to come to life and attack any tomb looters.  To the north appears another
long, narrow tunnel, though oddly the light coming from that direction seems
refracted into many different colors.

Hall of Mirrors~
Strange.  The stone walls, instead of remaining blank stone, instead meld
into a form of highly reflective quartz - so reflective, in fact, that the
underlying quartz patterns are almost impossible to see, and the reflection
of anyone passing through is repeated infinitely in their strange depths. 
Whatever little light is shining in here has no apparent source.  The
pathway heads north and south back to the crypt.

Hall of Mirrors~
Mirrored walls reflect in every direction.  A staircase heads both up and
down to even more mirrored walls.  Is there even an exit to this madness? 
It's impossible to tell what entrance is real and what just doubles back and
follows the same path as before.  And the millions of reflections in the
mirrored surfaces certainly don't seem to be helping matters much.

Secret Tunnel~
Finally!  The secret tunnel is very small, almost too small to navigate. 
It's a mystery how anyone could have brought Vault treasures down here, in
fact.  Maybe they magically shrunk their artifacts to fit them through.  In
any case, the tunnel itself heads to the north and upwards back to that
annoying hall of mirrors.

Into the Depths~
This path heads continually deeper underground.  Judging by sheer travel
time, it must be several miles underground at least.  The magic that must
have been at work to carve this place had to have been colossal.  The
pathway heads south to the narrow secret tunnel, and a slope travels down
even deeper.  There is no light down this far, and the rocks are fairly
jagged and rough.  Slow going, unless you're a dwarf who knows how to travel
underground well.

Descending~
The slope takes a rather alarming angle at this point, almost making
travellers upon it slide down whether they want to or not.  It's just solid
enough, and has enough rocky bumps and ridges, to be able to navigate safely
down at a slow enough pace.  The chittering of insects is, as always,
omnipresent, though there's the faint sound of something rumbling far down
below.  Not a particularly good sign.

Before the Well of Souls~
The howling of wind is the first herald of what is to come.  The low,
almost melancholy tone lingers in the dank air of the cave tunnel, bringing
with it the scent of mold and mildew.  Something else is here, too - the
faint, extremely odd sense of /power/.  An electric tingling is in the air,
much like standing outside just after a strong thunderstorm.  The pathway
heads north and the sense gets stronger in that direction.

Floating in the Well~
Floating on nothingness!  The ledge abruptly ends, and thanks to flying
abilities, it's possible to hover in mid-air in this place.  It's simply
enormous - almost too far to see even with the strongest light.  It's a huge
fissure deep in the earth though perfectly round.  Its diameter must measure
in the miles, much like the one far earlier in the Vault, only on an even
greater scale.  The electric 'tingling' feeling intensifies upon travelling
further downwards.  Strange creatures float about in the Well too, but they
don't look particularly friendly.

Heading to the Source~
The source of the howling wind - and of the electric feeling - must be
somewhere ahead, for they both get stronger the further down one travels. 
The walls of this vertical passage are perfectly and utterly smooth from the
centuries of wind movement.  A vague light glows from somewhere down far
below.  Interesting.

Heading to the Source~
The light grows stronger down further below, and the empty passage begins
to curve gently again into a form of slope.  Though it looks completely
smooth and streamlined, there's no possible way that nature could have made
such a perfectly elegant shape.  Glowing runes swirl on the stone walls like
living creatures.

Nexus of Power~
Amazing.  Whoever built this must have been a master of the arcane art. 
Four narrow catwalks float in midair in this enormous stone chamber, leading
to four seperate floating chambers.  These large, rounded creations simple
hang in the air like stars, all glowing with a multitude of spiralling runes
that make a startlingly beautiful pattern when stared at for long.  A runed
set of doors are actually set horizonally into the floor, with a fairly
obvious keyhole in the center of it.  A trapdoor, perhaps.  However, this
glowing archway is guarded by the large statue standing protectively in
front of it.

Statue of Gargnath~
This floating, runed chamber is devoted, it would appear, to the troll
wizard Gargnath of the days long past.  The stone structure of the chamber
is perfectly smooth and void of any corners, though a pristine marble
platform holds the statue itself in the center of the room.  A number of
scrolls, books, and tomes are scattered about the base of the platform, in
excellent condition given the tremendous age of the place.

Statue of Velar~
The enchanted chamber is runed completely; every wall, the ceiling, and
the floor are plastered with glowing, writhing letters, and thus illuminate
the place nicely.  The shrine is devoted to a long-forgotten member of the
ancient Shandalar politics.  Judging by the amount of old weapons and
battle-related scrolls lying scattered before the statue's marble pedastal,
he must have been a warrior of some kind.

This stone chamber is much darker than the others.  Not much light shines
in from the central chamber, though the runes here do add a slight amount of
illumination.  This one has an onyx platform in the center of the room,
piled high around the edge of it with, of all things, plants.  Small vases
and jars hold dirt, and from the dirt sprout a variety of bright flowers,
ferns, and small trees.  The protective magic must have kept them alive for
all these years.

This chamber is filled with a bright, divine white light that seems to
shine in from everywhere at once.  Unlike the other Nexus chambers, this one
has no old items lying on the ground near the marble platform.  This one,
instead, is perfectly blank, even of runescript on the walls.  The marble
platform is of the purest-cut rock, gleaming with an inner blue fire.  An
ethereal, divine humming noise fills the room, oppressing the senses.

A set of glowing, crystal spiral stairs head down from the main nexus
chamber, heading deeper down into the belly of the huge circular chamber. 
Glowing motes of light flit about at random, illuminating the pathway
beyond.  However, a short distance down there appears a faintly glowing blue
barrier, blocking the way downwards completely and resistant to all manner
of attacks.

An eerie humming noise permeates this place, the stairs having ended at a

twisting out of sight whenever they are looked at.  Another glowing blue
barrier blocks the way to the north and obscures whatever might be in that
direction.

This is the true glory of Shandalar!  Paintings line every part of the
smooth stone walls, illuminated, each and every one, with the glowing motes
of bright light.  Statues of the important figures of Dominia's past line
the walls, some in combat with nefarious villains and evil invaders.  Many
of the paintings depict dragons being slain in quite a few grisly ways.  The
omnipresent humming noise grows louder when one travels further to the
north.

Resting Place of the Dominian Kingsword~
The end of the Walk of Glory is no less incredible than the pathway
itself.  The walkway leads to a large crystal chamber, the walls, ceiling
and floor faceted to look like the entire room is actually /inside/ a
massive gem.  Rising from the center of the floor is a single crystal
pillar, with a silvery, narrow sword resting serenely atop it.  However,
merely taking the famous Dominian Kingsword would not be quite so easy as
merely grabbing it -- swirling around the pillar is a ghostly, dragon-like
figure.

Gargnath's Observatory~
The observatory obviously has been abandoned for quite some time.  It's a
large, round room with a high, domed ceiling.  The walls, ceiling and floor
are built out of stout wooden beams, and a moderate glow of light shines in
from several windows spaced high along the walls.  Tables, chairs, and paper
of various kinds are scattered about on the floor, as well as a great deal
of sky-charts littering the walls: constellations, mostly.  The only exit
appears to be a small wooden ladder heading up into a loft.

Dome of the Observatory~
The upper walkway of the observatory is fairly narrow.  It's even more
narrow considering that it's piled high with all manner of objects,
including tables, benches, and workplaces.  Jutting up through the wooden
floorboards is the massive cylinder of the telescope itself.  The object
dominates most of the observatory, cutting a clear line through the arching
wooden ceiling of the building.  Perhaps you could "look <direction>" to
look through the telescope in that direction.  (Make sure you're wearing no
items with the words 'north' or south' etc in them.)

Down there is the rest of the observatory.  Nothing really interesting

north~
Northwards through the telescope is little more than a massive mountain
range in the distance.  It's an eerily beautiful sight - endless forest and
jungle right up to the horizon, where it ends in a massive ridge of hills
and alps.  Misty fog drifts around those peaks like a ghostly shadow.  
 
~
E
south~
Southwards is water, as far as the eye can see.  A good distance in that
direction is mostly jungle, but it eventually becomes the white strand of
beach that inches towards the water itself.  It's impossible to tell from
this distance if it's an ocean or merely a huge lake, but it certainly
doesn't look very familiar.  How strange.  
~
E
west~
Westwards is a varying map of the land below.  For the most part, the
surrounding countryside is nothing more than dense jungle, with the
occasional mountain peak jutting up through the canopy of green.  However,
there are a few spots where the sun shines off of large lakes or meandering
rivers.  There's little sign of civilization at all, except for one possible
spot - far, far to the west there appears the faint glow of a city of some
kind.  Perhaps this far-off vision is Shandalar itself.  If so, no doubt
Gargnath's tower must be a massive distance to the east.  
~

Eastwards is very little of interest - merely a huge swath of green
jungle stretching from horizon to horizon.

Upwards is the sky. You've seen that before, haven't you?

Center of the Garden~
The garden is huge!  Plants and trees sprawl out in all directions,
making travelling almost impossible except for the small brick paths in the
four cardinal directions.  Enormous ferns splay out overhead, blocking some
of the sunlight and the bright blue sky.  The clouds overhead, however,
don't move a single inch - obviously this is no ordinary place.  Huge trees
loom ominously over the paths, and a floating doorway is, no doubt, the only
exit out of this odd place.

North End of the Garden~
The north end of the garden is devoted to, it would seem, shrub and berry
bushes.  The scent of fruit drifts through the air - strawberries,
raspberries, blueberries, peaches on short little peach trees.  It's all
confined in a tangle of larger oaks, but still fairly easy to navigate. 
There's even a small spring of water that trickles down from deeper in the
forest.

The south end of the garden is devoted solely to flowers.  The trees of
the central garden open up to an enormous, rolling field full of bright,
colorful flowers of every variety and description.  The field itself is
blocked off with massive, hulking trees, but the field itself seems calm and
pleasant.  A faint flute tune drifts through the endless sea of color. 
Seems like this would be a good place to relax for a while and regain lost
strength.

tangle of seeking greenery.  Most of them have some sort of flower or
blossom upon it.  The air is heavy with the scent of the plants, and with
the mild drone of insects heading here or there through the plants.

years of leaves crunches underfoot.  There's a staggering variety here -
oaks, birches, yews, and some that are just plain unidentifiable.  The
cheery call of birdsong echoes from somewhere overhead.

Bottom of the Gorge~
This seems to be the very bottom of the huge tunnel.  It's vast,
incredibly so - the walls are too far apart for any light source to reach
both sides at once.  The stone is surprisingly smooth, as if polished over
thousands of years.  At the bottom lies a number of old skeletons and bones,
no doubt other travellers and cave animals who've fallen in over the
centuries.  Along the side of one wall is a set of carved stone stairs.

Up the Stairs~
The rocky stairs continue up the side of the cliff face, heading in a
lazy, vague spiral towards the upper ledge.  There are markings along the
wall almost the whole length of the stairs themselves -- carvings and
etchings set into the stone cliff face itself.  They depict an odd, motley
assortment of creatures: gargoyles, slivers, trolls, even kirre, all
marching in formation.  Strange.  To the west there appears a large, shallow
ledge.

say Dominia is the home of all manner of species not native to Terra -- trolls, gargoyles, slivers, and kirre.
say They are, by and large, quite powerful indeed.
say It may not have the huge civilizations that Terra has, but perhaps.. who knows what the future brings.

say Bosco? Pfah. Hardly a challenge for my might. The children of Bosco are weak. 
say Dragons are particularly vulnerable to a certain kind of magic, which I have named 'dragon-slaying' weapons.
say They take tremendous damage from them. Use these tools against dragons to defeat them easily!
say Bosco will never reign over Dominia as long as my faithful keep fighting.
