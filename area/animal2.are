Sir Hosis of the Liver~
Sir Hosis of the Liver stands before you.
~
Sir Hosis is a brave, proud man of middle years, who has sworn by
his God and his Honour to protect Animaland from harm until death
takes him from this world. He is a just man, though, and is more
than helpful and courteous to peaceful visitors.

A Knight who says "Ni!"~
A Knight who says "Ni!" demands a shrubbery from you.
~
This fellow is a rather odd, demented knight who has fallen from
his role as a protector of animal town to a lordless wanderer cursed
by the Witch to seek out shrubberies. The whole affair has made him
rather crabby, and he's likely to take it out on you!

The First Little Pig~
The First Little Pig oinks petulantly at you.
~
This stout little porker is the rather unwise porcine chap who built
his adobe from straw, infuriating insurance assessors and tempting
the BBW (Big Bad Wolf) into detroying it, until the pig's older brother
helped him out and deterred BBW from such activities.

The Second Little Pig~
The Second Little Pigs struts proudly outside his wooden A-frame.
~
This progressive porker decided to advance on his brother's work and
build a house of wood, slightly more attractive, but no less safe from
the BBW (not to mention nasty draughts and forest fires). He also ran
to the eldest pig for succor, and now everything's jake (for now).

This pig is a rather overbearing fellow with a nasty temper, but he is
nonetheless quite bright (he built his house of brick, remember?), and
fiercely protective of his younger brothers. He does not look 
particularly happy to see you...This is not surprising considering the
fact that you've most probably jsut slain his brethren swine...

The Path leading to Animaland~
You are strolling along a well-trodden path that leads towards the
boundaries of the mysterious realm of Animaland. At this point it
may not be inappropriate to consult your history books and learn
about the place (type `help animaland'). You see a broad, swiftly-
flowing river up ahead, which you can cross via a ford. However,
a well-armored knight standing outside a stone tower near the ford
makes you hesitate...
There is a sign here you may want to read...

As you near the ford, you also grow nearer this weathered stone tower,
which looks older than your Aunt Ethyl... A very odd-looking coat of arms
hangs above the door, which is stoutly locked (you can't go in, so don't
bother with this 'look door', 'op n', 'op door' crap ok? :P). The ford 
look simple enough- step on and across the shallow bit to the other side,
which is very green and rather pleasant-looking.

You are standing knee-deep in soft, green grass which covers this

sward, going in many directions. Birds glance at you as they fly
far overhead, and you fancy that you see a glimmer of intelligence
in their beady eyes.

owner. If you have items that are broken, he's the one to help you-
if not, you're wasting his time, and he stares at you impatiently,
eager to get back to his work.

You are inside Bear Mayor's (or Mayor Bear's- he uses both titles with
impunity) air-conditioned office. Portraits of famous animals, all
signed, line the walls, and an impressive collection of animal-related
literature is held in a solid oak set of shelves behind his huge timber
desk. The desk itself is scattered with papers that relate to the day

administration and payoffs...

election), Warthog fled to Castle Poodle and became a Jester, and the
business fell into ruin. Now there is nothing save some scraps of
decaying meat and a couple of dulled butcher's knives.

to go as far abroad as the River Fulem for their water. Tipsy, the

forgets that its empty and ends up falling in while trying to get

The Stairs Up~
You begin the long haul up the narrow flight of steps to the abode
of Wizard Owl. Along the way there are some marvelous portraits of
great thinkers in the animal world such as P.S.Boxer, Ursiniquis,
Felinia Maximia, Sir B. Terrier and St. Equinus of the Stable.

Owl's Study~
You have entered the Sanctum Sanctorum of The Wizard Owl. As you enter,
he regales you with a long string of calculations, asks your opinion on
their accuracy, then promptly whips out a book and begins to read. 
Momentarily ignored, you glance about the room, amazed and impressed by
the range of alembics, beakers, cisterns, decanters, eggtimers, feathers,
gemstones, hangings, items, jpegs, krators, looms, manuals, necronomicons,
objects d'art, posters, question sheets, rulers, sheets, telescopes,
ultraviolet art, vampire bats, walrus tusks, x-ray machines, yellow powders
and zoo exhibits.
