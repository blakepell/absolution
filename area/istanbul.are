A Gory Pit~
As you jump down into the pit, you lose your footing and tumble to the
ground.  Regaining your breath, you look about and find several decapitated
bodies lying near you, adorned in nothing but the blood which once filled
their veins.  Standing up, you notice a tiny fire flickering violently in
the far corner.

The Loft~
The stench of blood causes bile to rush to your throat.  As you fight the
urge to vomit, you peer about through watery eyes and determine that the
source of the stench is a large carcass pinned to the wall by what remains
of the pitchfork in the room below.  Bales of hay line the walls of the
room, yet one bale seems to have been torn apart, and is smeared with dark
red blood.

A Dark Shape~
The buildings to your north are very close together, making for dark,
mysterious alleys.  Looking down several you spot a dark shape moving
quickly between the alleys, pausing several times as if studying you.  As you
spot the shape again, it suddenly recoils as if in fear and disappears into
the darkness.

A Southern Street~
This east-west running street holds nothing of extreme interest, except
for the large blood stains which seem to lie everywhere.  Cleaners are
furiously scrubbing at the stains, in the hopes of removing the scent, so
that no wild beasts will descend upon the area.  This is obviously a town
which lives in constant fear of threats real and imagined.

The Grand Entrance~
Heavily fortified, the door to the south actually consists of 4 separate
sections.  Several strange runes adorn the floor here.  A heavy drawbridge
ensures that there is no crossing the moat while it is down.  The doors all
glow faintly, as if protected by some unknown magic.  To the north, the vast
city stands.

You are at the intersection of the Trader's Way and the Northern wall.

path continues to your west.

The Northern Path~
This filthy stretch of road runs from east to west along the northern
wall.  Hungry street urchins reach out to you for help, moaning deliriously
in seeming pain.  As you glance at them more closely, however, the moans
turn to laughs, the sobs to sneers, and the tears to blood.  Blinking the
sweat from your eyes causes the shapes to twist and writhe, until they
disappear completely.  You are left standing on an empty road.

Along the Wall~
The northern wall looms before you, casting a dark shadow on this part of

continues.  Several beggars plead for help, but when you gaze at them they
scurry back into the darkness from which they came.

walls in case of an emergency situation. You wonder however at some
of the statues of gods that also adorn every corner of the room.

Along the Wall~
A well trodden path leads north to a stone guard tower.  There, is little
movement here with the exception of a guard patrol that wanders about,
oblivious to your presence.  Looking east towards the wall, you notice the
stonework is newly laid and heavily reinforced.

Along the Wall~
The walls of the village are west of you. Tapping your weapon 
against the wall you are reassured that the walls are
extremely thick and well built. You are soon distracted from the 
walls by the smell of fresh bread. Looking to the east you see
a bakery.

You find yourself on a gloomy, dark stretch of road.  Garbage is piled
high on the sides of the road, and you can hear the shuffling of feet around
you.  As you glance around you, sets of small red eyes can be seen observing
you.  You'd best hurry through this section of town.

familiar to you, yet somehow, the bile rising in your throat tells you that
the source won't be pleasing.

The Trader's Way~
A few shoppers roam the streets, looking bored.  Aside from these
slack-jawed people, the streets are almost deserted.  To the west you see a
sign with a green troll painted on it.  To the east you hear music and
shouts of laughter.

to brown, along the same shape as the pattern etched into the ground.

the slight ridges appear.  You wonder what the symbol may be, but it is too
large and you are too close to discern any recognizable shape.

of the moat, flowing gently around the walls.  Stone carvings adorn this
tower, giving it an almost life-like quality.  Its almost as if the
gargoyles could come to life at any moment...

otherwise.  Glancing away from town, you notice a thick fog gathers just
inches from the village's moat.  As a shiver runs up your spine, you hear a
crow screeching in the fog, mocking you.

stain on the floor.  A sudden image flashes into your mind, and you see a
person writhing in pain on the floor before you before suddenly going rigid.
Rolling the body over, your own face stares back at you.  Stepping back, you
watch as the body decays, as if time is moving very fast, until only the
stain remains.

fog isn't moving at all.  It is as if the fog were frozen in time somehow. 
Again and again, the howl permeates the silence, until you are uncertain
which direction it is coming from.

covered in an intricate design of some holy symbol you cannot quite
recognize.  All you know is that in this room, you are safe.

state.  Slowly, the haunting sound fades away into the distance.

of the wall collapsing, and of brave knights being torn asunder by dark
shapes.  You are startled into awareness by the sound of a cricket in the
darkness.

jump here and there. The jumping rabbits cause a dizzying pattern
and you begin to feel ill.

A Treasurey Room~
You've stumbled upon a hidden room under the village. Vast amounts 
of treasure fill the room, and you scramble to take all you can.

The Upper Housing~
You've entered a narrow alley in what appears to be the central housing
district. Homes seem to dot the whole wall and you estimate that there
are about a hundred homes here. Of course many of these homes are at 
best only temporary, but they provide adequate shelter against the weather
elements and anything else that might come knocking.

Although a bit small, this house has all it's furniture placed in the

A simple lifestyle is the story behind this home. A medium sized bed,
a dining table, a couch and a closet are all that is in this home. You

model seems to have been used for all the houses. Once again homes have
been piled on top of each other giving them a tower like look to them.

A home~
A pile of ashes lay smoldering in a pit situated in the middle of the 
room. The warmth from the dying fire provides a little sanctuary from 
the coldness of the outside. A simple bed and table are all the pieces 
of furniture in the house.

You stumble into a section which doesn't quite fit the rest of the
housing development.  Its very quiet here, in fact, you don't hear anything
at all.  As you examine the doors to the north and south you suddenly feel a
chill run down your spine.  Light pours down from the floor above you.

A Damp Home~
As you enter the room you are overcome by a sickeningly familiar smell. 
Blood.  Glancing around, however, you cannot discern where the scent is
coming from.  You are jolted into awareness as something splatters onto your
shoulder, splashing onto your face.  Glancing slowly upwards your vision
finally comes across the source of the smell.  On the ceiling is a large red
carcass, speared into the ceiling with a broken pitchfork.  The blood pours
off the end of the fork and vanishes into thin air.

A Dark Dwelling~
As you enter this abode, all the light seems to be drawn away.  Suddenly
you are thrust into near-darkness, and vertigo overcomes you.  Then, as you
find your balance, you are stricken by a bout of panic, for no reason you
can fathom.  Instantly, however, the sensation fades, and the room brightens
considerably.

Top of the Stairs~
This upper level of housing seems to have been a good idea. Considering
the spacing that the city walls provide, there's not much room to
build on the ground. Luckily some smart architect decided to build
up. A few closed doors tells you that the homes are likely occupied
and doubtless you are not welcome here.

A home~
A small table and set of chairs is the only furnishings of this home
other than the bed. These homes are rather small and likely are only
temporary. You doubt that even a goblin could live more than two

to be relatively clean. Judging from the garden tools stacked in the

You've walked into a secret room in Harold's Inn. Lush pillows are strewn
about the floor. Soft carpeting and dim lighting provide ample atmosphere
for a romantic evening. Straining your eyes to the far corner you see 
a strange wooden bed. In fact you would think it was a rack to stretch
people out on. It even has manacles?! Hmmm.... Your attention is diverted
to the large bed in the other corner. It looks quite comfy and better yet
it looks like it's for two... or more.

that you can reach by scaling the earthy walls.

villagers above.  You stand ankle deep in soil mixed with their blood.

the impaled body of a town guard.  A large spear thrusted into the ground
hoists his very dead body into the air.

Though lacking any leaves, the fresh roots that have only recently sprouted,
have already made its way just below the grounds surface.  The tree seems to
vibrate with energy.

the door to an old mausoleum.  The stone work is ancient, yet the structure
has been preserved perfectly inside this hallowed cavern.  A shiver rolls
down you spine as you look at the stone gargoyles that guard the entrance. 
Their eyes seem to stare at your every move.  You shudder from the coldness
and try to shake off the fear.

clean of any webbings and bones.  What it does contain however are two large
stone tables situated side by side.  Your heart stops as you look down upon
two dead women.  They're recent death is evident only upon their lack of
decay.  So serene are their faces you think them to be only sleeping.

their cubby holes, have disintergrated over the centuries that have gone by.
Cobwebs from the ceiling hang down forming an eerie but natural drapery,
just shielding the stone door to the north.  Brushing aside the webs, you
make out the name 'STRAHD' etched into the door.

previous inhabitants went.  Aside from the dust and cobwebbs, very little

north, or you can climb the cliffside, to your east.
