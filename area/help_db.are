~0 DIKU~
Original game idea, concept, and design: 

Katja Nyboe [Superwoman] (katz@freja.diku.dk)
Tom Madsen [Stormbringer] (noop@freja.diku.dk)
Hans Henrik Staerfeldt [God] (bombman@freja.diku.dk)
Michael Seifert [Papi] (seifert@freja.diku.dk)
Sebastian Hammer [Quinn] (quinn@freja.diku.dk) 

Developed at: DIKU -- The Department of Computer Science
at the University of Copenhagen.~
55 DISPERSE~
DISPERSE: The idea is to shoot certain objects all over the mud, and giving
the certain item to mobs all over, but not forcing them to wear it.~
53 ADDRECRUITER DROPRECRUITER SWAPLEADER LEADERCOMMANDS LEADER DELEGATE~
Syntax: addrecruiter <your password> <new recruiter> 
 
-This command advances or sets the trust on a member of
your clan to recruiter stats. You require a free recruiter
slot for this to work. 
 
Syntax: droprecruiter <your password> <old recruiter> 
 
-This command demotes a current recruiter in your clan
to level 51 or removes the trust on them. This frees up
a slot for a new recruiter.
 
Syntax: swapleader <your password> <new leader> 
 
-This command drops you to lvl 51 or removes your trust as
a leader. It also replaces you with a new leader who is 
promoted. 
 
Syntax: delegate <recruiter> <level> 
 
- Delegate is a powerful ability the leader of a clan can 
bestow on his most prized recruiters. When the recruiter is 
delegated, that person gains the ability to loner people in 
the clan. The recruiter can loner people up to level 52 or the 
set level, whichever is lower. 
 
(See also 'help CLANSTATS' 'help CLANMEMBERS' 'help PRICES' 'help LONER'
'help ACCEPT')~
0 CLANSTATS CLANMEMBERS OFFLINE LONER 'OFFLINE LONER'~
Clan leaders may request from the IMMs a list of their goon and clan hall
stats, as well as a list of current members, twice a year. Once during the
first week of February and again during the first week of August. Clan
stats and a list of clan members can also be requested in the event of the
take over of a new clan leader. 
 
Level 59 immortals can offline loner a clan member ONLY at the request of the
clan's leader.  Immortals will not loner more than 10 percent of a clans 
membership per month.
 
(see 'help LEADERCOMMANDS' and 'help PRICES')done~
0 GOLD SILVER MONEY~
Midgaard's economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the lowly copper,
which you, as an adventurer, are far too proud to carry). Gold coins are 
worth 100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the pound, 
as opposed to 100 to the pound for silver). Gems can be bought to alleviate
weight problems from the Midgaard's jeweler, who charges a mere 10% more 
than they are worth. 10 gems weigh one pound, and can be worth more than 100
gold pieces for the highest quality stones. 

You can also deposit your money on a bank note. See 'help bank' for more
information.~
0 BRIEF COMPACT~
Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact removes 
the extra blank line before your prompt.~
0 DEAF~
The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpful if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players. You can still use reply (see 'help reply') 
to reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a deity (it's mostly 
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).~
0 AFK~
Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
replay. This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells. AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off. You may also type 'replay' while AFK. 

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay when they reconnect (unless, of course, the character
logs off before reading them).~
0 54 BUILDER~
These Immortals are the area builders of Redemption. You might never see a
level 54 IMM since they are usually WIZI when they are on-line. Level 54s 
can only build and have no other powers.~
0 55 ANGEL~
Level: 55 [ANGEL]
 
There are brand new immortals on Redemption. They are responsible for
running frequent tournaments, supervising channels, and making sure
that Redemption life is as good as it can get. They can help newbies
and cash in enchant vouchers, but cannot load items or do restrings.~
0 56 DEMIGOD~

These immortals are here to help the game go along a lot smoother and 
easier for everyone, interacting a lot with mortals and lower level
immortals.

easier for everyone. These are the lowest level administrative staff; they

-running mutinies
-editing help files
-approval mobprogs
-supervising builders
-helping with the web page~
0 59 CREATORS~
Level: 59 [CREATORS] 
 
These immortals are here to help the game go along a lot smoother and
easier for everyone. These are the direct assistants to the Implementors.
 
These IMMs deal with signficant and weighty issues. They can give out
extremely harsh punishments, signficantly affect the MUD, and do most
things the IMPs can do. If you need a level 60 for something, try a
level 59 first. They can deal with almost any problem a mortal might have.
 
These people are responsible for the following:
-Fixing typos in descriptions in the game
-Supervising builders
-Web page maintenance
-Punishment requests by lower level imms for deny/half
-Coding

0 60 IMPLEMENTORS~
Level: 60 [IMPLEMENTORS] 

They are in charge of setting rules, maintaining game balance, and keeping
the code working. If a lower-level IMM is on who can help you please ask them
first. 
 
These IMMs run and own the game. They are ultimately responsible for
all decisions. They supervise all groups and are responsible for all
the immortals.
 
These people are responsible for the following:
-Complaints about immortals
-Hiring, promoting and demoting immortals
-Installing new areas
-Anything requiring shell, such as clan member lists
-Coordination with PC
-Anything else that cannot be delegated.~
0 IMMORTAL~
Redemption will periodically ask for player applications to fill new IMM
or builder spots.  People applying for builder spots must have a well
developed idea of an area they would like to build, credentials speaking to
their ability to build, and the time commitment to get the area finished
within in reasonable amount of time.  People applying for IMM spots should
have superiour game knowledge, no history of cheating, time to dedidcate to
the game, and a proven history of service to Redemption.  Builders will be
hired to level 54, IMMs to level 55.  A player who has another character
that is a clan or guild leader or recruiter will NOT be considered for an
IMM position.  IMMs who are applying but have a level 51 character. 
Builders must have a character that is level 51, or has remorted or
reclassed.  
 
Level 54s are builders. Her/His job is to build an original area on 
Redemption. Once the area is finished and approved by several imms, checked
for both appropriate balance and well written descriptions, it will be put
into the game. If after a certain amount of time the area is not
adequately completed, the builder will be removed. Upon completion of the
area, the builder will be removed, and that person may be encouraged to
apply to become a level 55 IMM.
 
Level 55 IMMs will have the most direct player contact of all the
immortals. They are expected to run tournaments and events, and maintain
a healthy, friendly and fun atmosphere. After 3 to 6 months, a level 55
who has logged consistently and been helpful to the higher immortal
staff and contributed to the Redemption atmosphere may be promoted
to level 56.
 
Level 56 IMMs have more powers than level 55s. They can run more elaborate
quests, as well as give out greater punishments. Where a 55's job is to
interact frequently and joyfully with the mortal playerbase, a 56's job
is to supervise and contribute to the playerbase, and the lower level IMMs.
They will be required to supervise the 55s, check descriptions on builders'
areas, and give out stricter punishments.
 
Level 57 IMMs are administrative staff of Redemption. They can run complex
tournaments and help out the lower level immortals, but they can also vote,
and help maintain clan and guild affairs. They are also involved with helping
to check areas and anything else higher level IMMs may require.
 
Level 58 IMMs are extemely knowledgeable about the everyday workings of
an immortal's life. They are knowledgeable about Redemption and are confident
in their decisions. As such, they have important tasks such as editing help
files, approval mobprogs, supervising mutiny fights, and so on.
 
Level 59 IMMs are the assistants to the IMPs. They do everything that the
IMPs themselves cannot. They may have positions such as Head Builder or
Head Web Developer. They may be coders. They can also give out extremely
hefty punishments such as deny and half, and may be asked by lower level
IMMs to do so.
 
Level 60 IMPs are the Implementors of Redemption. They supervise and manage
the immortal community and are ultimately responsible for all decisions 
relating to Redemption. They supervise voting, the PC, hiring, promoting
and demoting imms, and anything that requires shell access.

or refer to 'help 5X' for the specific tasks of immortals of varying
levels.~

Also help on: DAMAGE DEATH EXPERIENCE STORY TICK WIZLIST~
0 DEATH~
When your character dies on Terra, you are reincarnated back at the Altar 
of the Temple of Midgaard. If you die on Dominia, you are reincarnated at
the Temple of Selina in Shandalar. If you joined a clan, you will be 
reincarnated inside your clan hall or outpost. Your corpse is left behind 
in the room where you were killed, together with all of your equipment. 

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death. 

You lose experience points for dying. The amount you lose is one-quarter of 
the way back to the beginning of your level. 

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real 
time). Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve
objects from a non-clanners corpse. Clanners may loot any other clanner's 
corpse with no negative repercussions. If the game crashed after you died, 
it's a good bet that you lost it. Please do not go begging to an immortal to 
help you get your equipment back - it's not their duty to get it back for you.~
0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience. You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points. 

You gain experience by:
-killing a creature on your own.
-being part of a group that kills a monster.
-getting better at a skill or spell. 

You lose experience by: 
-fleeing out of combat. 10exp
-recalling out of combat. 25exp
-being the target of energy drain spells.
-dying. 

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many 
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your 
alignment versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have 
been killed lately; your total hours; and some random variation. 

Once you level, several things happen. You gain a certain amount of hit
points, mana points, and practices, depending on various factors. You also
gain some movement points and one training session. Your experience points
until you next level is reset. You will also be able to wear new equipment, 
and gain access to new skills and spells.~
0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop. You may own only one pet at a time. After
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement. Your pet will follow you
everywhere you go and help you in your adventures.~
1 SEEKER HISTORY~
The Seekers of Redemption are Redemption's only clan with a nonviolent
concept. By aiding others and bettering ourselves, we try to build a better
world for all. Together, we can triumph where our pride led us to fail 
alone.
{x
A Seeker shall avoid death at all costs.  Fighting another player is
forbidden unless that person has sought their death and no other alternative
remains.  Seekers shall save their own lives at any cost.
{x
Duels are prohibited without express permission of a Master.
Hunting or aggressive pkill is expressly forbidden.
{x
A Seeker's first loyalty is to his or herself, and then to his Master.
Finally, his loyalty is to his clan.  By learning his or her own self, they
can best find redemption.
{x
A Seeker must give any aid that they can to others who do not seek to attack
or harm them or other Seekers.  This requirement does not mean that the
Seeker must devote all their time to aiding others, but simply that
they attempt to do what they can and chose to do.
{x
Each Seeker's behavior reflects upon his master, and each Master is directly
responsible for his Apprentices and Journeymen of her house.
{x
Seekers must seek a Master and follow him until they reach their Master
level. Masters may be assigned at the Apprentice's request, and if a Master
should leave the clan or become an immortal, a new Master will be found.

0 KINDRED HISTORY~
Kindred History:
 
Before Kindred, there was Amazon. A clan where females ruled and the males were
second rate citizens. Eventually, Samantha became leader and changed the clan 
into what you now know as Kindred.
 
Kindred has always been a clan about chaos. Ever since the beginning, with 
Samael being the more prominent of the first leaders, chaos was the Kindred 
trademark. The clan flourished under Samael's rule but eventually, like all 
good things, they must come to an end. He made a grievious error. He 
overextended his powers and he lost the clan to Gibetto. With Gibetto the clan 
was even more chaotic. There were little to no rules and recruitment was 
invitation only. Kyler was then given leadership but no changes were made. 
Eventually Sauron came to rule where he has ruled for a long time.
 
Little has changed since then. Now, however, the times are changing and a 
little order is emerging from the chaos. Kindred have always been known as 
killers of anyone and everyone. Such is a valid way of spreading chaos. 
However, other things were chaotic but didn't end up helping them as killers. 
Random lootings for example serve little purpose other than spreading chaos. 
Or just being generally mean.
 
It is time to focus on sheer killing. Welcome to Kindred.
 
Recruiting Polices:
 
- Minimum of 15 pkills.
- Minimum of a 3 pkills to 1 pkilled ratio.
- Minimum character level of 20 for non-remorts and non-reclasses.
- Minimum character level of 10 for remorts and reclasses.
- Minimum of 3k experience per level for human/elf
                5k experience per level for dwarf/troll/giant
                6k experience per level for sliver/gargoyle/kirre
                8k experience per level for a dragon
- To be admitted, a donation is required:
        10k for levels 20-29
        15k for levels 30-39
        20k for levels 40-49
        25k for levels 50 and 51
        30k for remorts and reclasses
- There may be a test which is up to the recruiter or leader being asked for        
recruitment to decide upon.
- Your race and class will also be taken into consideration.
 
Kindred Ranks:
 
- Based solely on number of pkills. Those with more pkills will 
be of higher rank. 
        Initiate                15-50 pkills
        Spellblade              51-100 pkills
        Bounty Hunter           101-200 pkills
        Assassin                201-300 pkills
        Slayer                  301-500 pkills
        Executioner             above 500 pkills
        Deathmaster(s)          Recruiter(s)
        The Grim Reaper         Leader
 
Kindred Rules:
- Respect your clanmates.
- There is to be no grouping with Justice. They are contrary in their beliefs 
helping the weak.
- Do not worship Bhaal. Any other God is acceptable.
- Do not spam kill. (No multiple killing of the same player within an hour 
unless this player gets a killer/thief flag, attacks a kindred (includes with 
charmies) or steals from a kindred).
- Kindred may loot potions, pills, gems which are not restrung from various 
quests, vouchers, magic items(wands, staves, scrolls, throwing items), gold and 
bank notes. 
- Two other items may be looted which are not quest items, restrung items or    
craft items.
- Any piece of equipment which no longer exists such as 50hp farslayers will 
likely be confiscated and it doesen't count as   an item that can be looted.
- Kills involving charmies will not be looted.
- Should a mob get the kill when a player was almost killed by a Kindred, the 
corpse will be exchanged for the pkill.
- Disarmed weapons, ripped held items, detonated weapons and attracted/heat 
metalled equipment are to be returned in person after the combat. Generally 
when one player has successfully made it to hall.
- A Kindred is responsible for the corpse if they get the kill. Should the 
corpse "disappear", the Kindred will help re-equip the player whose corpse is 
missing (However craft, quest and restrings are time consuming to obtain and

0 VENARI HISTORY~
==================================================
{rVenari - Guardians of Dominia, Scourge of Dragons{x
==================================================
"Follow thy heart"
Shouldst thou seeketh to join our valiant clan, thoust must prove thyself.
Knowledge is what ye want, if ye have that, ye are akin to thee.
==================================================
{DGreetings traveller, you wish to know the history of Venari? Harken to
my tale... 
 
Selina was akin to Bosco long ago, before memory and lore. Though
spirited, she grew weary of Terra (as Bosco's realm was named) and its
inhabitants, for the wyrms had begun to multiply in startling numbers,
and she hated their arrogant nature. Anticipating their eventual rule, she
fled the lands, and with her will parted the waters of the Dragon Sea to
reveal a vast new land, uncluttered and serene. She created new children to 
dwell on Dominia; from that time on, gargoyles, trolls and slivers roamed
unrestrained without fear or hatred, and Selina was content. Being weary
of her labours, she forsook the Mortal realm and departed, never to be seen
by Mortal eyes again.
 
However, the peace on Dominia was not to last. After the fall of
Bosco, the proud wyrms attacked Selina's realm with a vengeance, seiging
the lands and marring her works. Dominia was thriving when it was uncovered 
by the fruitless wyrms. Their innate greed had grown too large, and they tried
to take something that was not theirs. Selina's children were united under two
great men, King Lawrygould and Gargnoth. But all the forces of slivers, trolls, 
and gargoyles could not hold off the mighty dragon hordes. 
 
Then, as all seemed to be lost, Selina then returned to her children and brought 
us the warrior StarCrossed, who rose from the ashes to help Dominia fight the 
wyrms. War ensued, with many heroes born and lost, but much of the knowledge 
of that age was lost in the heat of battle (thus, this story is told as a legend). 
Finally, the wyrms were driven from the capital and cast into the Dragon Sea, 
forever exiled to Terra.
 
StarCrossed, who had escaped unscathed, gathered her warriors and 
together they forged the clan Venari, the Dragon Slayers of Dominia, 
Guardians of the East, and upholders of Selina's will.
 
Selina had used up all but her last bit of energy to defeat the last of the 
invading force. Alas it is said at the end of the war Selina was unable to 
remain in physical form, and departed back into the Divine Realm.
 
Years passed, StarCrossed departed to the realm above, and yet we
still remain, ever stalwart in our beliefs. Many wise and venerable leaders
brought Venari into a new age where dragons are scarce. Life on Dominia
prospered for quite some time, until a lost soul disturbed a peacefully resting
StarCrossed. The wrath that followed was so mighty that the world itself was
purged in apocalyptic fire. Now, a new age now has come where the dragon
is quite prosperous, much to Selina's...delight. She has worked hard to recruit
the most notorious of her children to aid in the hunting of the invaders, and 
now the time has come. Her sole purpose is to restore Venari and bring
back the days of glory to its members. She wishes that we not only banish 
the enemy from our homeland, we shall invade Terra, until the foul smelling
wyrms numbers are so little that they will never flourish again.
 
Verily, the Kenshin invade our lands, and it is also said that the foul wyrms
have been sighted within our boundaries once again... How can this be?
They are all to be exterminated... as we will uphold our oath to purge the 
heretics, lest we induce the wrath of Selina above us. 
 
Venari will not falter, and as long we do not stray from Selina she will 
protect us; for we are her heirs, and only through our efforts will her 
legacy live on. Long live Selina's will and the will of the Venari!{x
==================================================
{c"Rivalry amongst thy clans."{x
 
{WKindred: The pure embodiment of evil, they hath caused havoc amongst
many a clans, moreover, they hath looted the lot of us from time to
time. Thy vile men will be hunted and shunned upon at all time.
They be looted at time tae. Watch thy back, should ye loot.
 
Seeker: They harth thy mother earth and seeketh peace onto thy very soul.
They be left alone, unless they be a dragon.
 
Kenshi: They seeketh chaos and destruction upon thy lands of Dominia.
They hath brought the plague unto thy lands, whose breath didst shiver
this land dry. They are to be hunted at ALL times.{x
==================================================
{R*Dragons branded.*{x
 
{D1.  Dragons are NOT welcome to Dominia, regardless of clan or stature.{x
{G2.  All Dragons on Terra are also to be hunted, regardless of clan or
     stature.{x
{B3.  Dominian races of peaceful nature are welcome to our continent. That
     is to say: Gargoyles, trolls, kirres and slivers who are not flagged are
     not to be attacked unless they are Kenshi or blacklisted.{x
{M4.  Dragons are not allowed in Venari, for any reason.{x
{Y5.  Remember, do NOT group with or aid Dragons in any way. Dragons in
     any clan can always be killed on any continent.{x
=================================================
{DRules for Venari
 
Under a new society given by Selina, Venari now bound only to 
themselves and the TeKarana. His word is law as told by Selina.
 
Selina's Will
 
{y- Dragons are to be hunted and killed if seen within the realm.
{c- Foreign races are not safe from death on our lands.
{m- Flagged Terran races are never safe from death.
{g- Once every two weeks Selina encourages a massacre upon the realm,
  where no person is immune to dying.
{r- No Venari member will dishonour Venari's name over public channels.
{b- Any insults towards other clans of an immature nature will be dealt with.{x
 
 
Ranks
 
{mLesser{x: These are new recruits to Venari's order. They are young 
and willing to kill in order to gain rank and respect in the eyes of their 
betters. In order for a lesser to become a DeathKnight or DeathPriest 
they must prove themselves in battle and donate 15k within their set 
probation time.
 
{rDeath{DKnight{x: The core of Venari's fighters, these warriors are highly 
trained in the art of combat. They are merciless and very powerful alone. 
In packs they will do just about anything to get a kill. Cross their paths at 
your own peril. They hunt down the weak for fun and kill enemies for a 
living. In order for a DeathKnight to become a TalnoyGuard they must 
donate 30k and choose another Talnoy to best in a duel to the death. 
Winner gets 10k and Venari gets the rest.
 
{rDeath{WPriest{x: The core of Venari's casters, these spellbinders claim to 
have contact with the goddess Selina and use her powers as their own. 
In tune with their surroundings DeathPriests can alter a battle quickly 
with few spells or bring the wrath of the Mad God Selina unto anyone 
who oppose them. DeathPriests must donate 30k and choose a 
TalnoyGuard to defeat in combat.
 
{YTalnoy{x: The TeKarana's personal guard and the most notorious 
members of the clan. These DeathKnights and DeathPriests are 
handpicked by the Leader of Venari for their qualities in killing and 
leadership. The Talnoy are easily some of the best fighters in the world. 
They are to uphold all rule when no leadership is present.
 
{RK{ya{Dra{Rn{ya{x: The recruiters of Venari. Smart, cunning, powerful. All of 
these qualities are required to run a clan full of murderous people. They always 
have the best interests of the clan in mind when making all decisions. 
Always to be respected in the highest regards, their word is trumped 
solely by that of the TeKarana.
 
Te{Rk{ya{Dra{Rn{ya{x: The Leader of Venari, and a god among men. With 
infinite amounts of wisdom, he directs the clan in such a way that is 
unrivaled by other leaders. It is said that the TeKarana acts on Selina's 
behalf as she communicates through him. He is a Vassal for the Great 
Goddess and thus is to be trusted in all aspects by Venari. 
============================================================~
1 KENSHI HISTORY~
{x     With the largest wars lost long ago in the sands of time, the 
clan known as Kenshi plagued the continent of Dominia for many years.  
They instilled fear, caused terror, disease, conflict, and death.  
But for the longest time, Kenshi did this without a true meaning or 
cause.  Despite this weakness, many fine heroes have led Kenshi.  From 
Sirichi and Anduil's time came our humble, meager beginnings, our 
honor. From Tobias and Krule, our strength. From Tigershark, Skyler, 
Nebrin, Skaleek, Khell and Zeth - our proud fighting history.
{x
{x     It was just recently, under a new more powerful leadership, 
Kenshi gained it's lost truth.  Remnant factions of the Great Dragon
War, most of whom found themselves lost in the mist of the Dragon Sea,
found survival at the shores of the enemy continent, Dominia.  Some 
were valiant forces that had served Bosco, others were simple 
mercenaries who completed gruesome tasks for riches.  For years and 
years, enduring the formation of Clan Venari, practically cut off 
from their home continent, the remaining remnants continue to fight 
for their blind cause.
{x
{x     We were few in number in the beginning, fighting honorably, but 
claiming very little glory or victory.  The remnants, which named 
themselves Kenshi, lay in the shadows, waiting for a newer, brighter 
age.  The days were long, and the blood of Kenshi was spilled onto the 
streets of Shandalar day after day.  Finally, the powerful necromancer
Tobias pulled Kenshi out of hiding, and back onto the battlefield with 
newfound strength. For the first time in decades, Venari began to fear 
our name.
{x
{x     Years have passed now, since Tobias revived Kenshi, and after 
surviving through many vicious mutinies and betrayals, wars and 
massacres, Kenshi remains strong.  We have adopted the cause of our
past, as mercenaries and remnant soldiers of Terra.  
{x
{x     Our task: The complete domination of all that stand in the way of
our glory, the destruction of clan Venari, and the rule of Dominia.
{x
{RRULES{r:{x
{x
{Do){x Leadership is in complete command at all times. Their word is 
Law. They are to be respected at all times, and disrespect can result
in lonering.  When Leadership is not present, the higher-ranking 
Kenshi are in charge.
{Do){x Respect your clan mates, for they are your kinfolk. They are 
the most important things to you - without them you are nothing.  
Protect your brothers at all costs!  
{Do){x All enemy clans and loners on Dominia are fair game.  However, 
some people may be deemed safe by leadership for political reasons;
these people are completely safe from Kenshi.  When in doubt, ask. 
{Do){x Justice and Seeker on Terra are safe unless flagged. If an 
unflagged member of Justice or Seeker attacks you, they are game for 
an hour. All other clans on Terra are game.
{Do){x Looting from corpses is limited to gold, potions, pills, wands,
staves, scrolls, gems, and vouchers. Any piece of equipment that no 
longer exists can be looted as long as it is not restrung or craft.
{Do){x Disarmed/gravved/stolen/ripped/detonated/heated items are to be
returned promptly in person at no cost to the victim, after any 
fighting is done.
{Do){x Grouping with enemy clans is frowned upon, but for the most 
part allowed.  Be wise for some clans may betray you.
{Do){x No spam killing. This means do not attack someone more then 
once an hour if they have already been killed. If they die to 
uncharmed mobs such as Cuervo, then they are still fair game. 
{Do){x The charmie limit is 2 except against other individuals who 
use more then 2. It is not legal to use max charmies on a player who 
has not been known to use max charmies his/herself.  If someone 
attacks you FIRST when you have more than 2 charmies, you are allowed
to stay in the battle, but you CANNOT chase them when they flee.
{Do){x Kenshi is not a babysitting clan.  People who constantly mooch
from the strong will be lonered and possibly killed.  
{Do){x Rules subject to change without notice. Check our Policies help
and clan note board for any particulars.
{x
{REye for an Eye{r:{x
{x
The only time looting something not listed above is permited is when 
someone loots something from you first. If they loot something of 
yours, loot the same thing back from them. Don't loot the next thing 
from the next person in the same clan as the person who looted you, 
this only starts wars. Loot from the person who looted. 
{x
{RRANKS{r:{x
{x
There are many ranks among the members of Kenshi, and just as in life,
your rank decides place, your say, and your authority.  Entrance 
members are given more general ranks, but as you become a more trusted
clan mate, your rank can become more specialized based on your skill, 
helpfulness and character build.
{x
--{yConscript {x- The entry rank into Kenshi.  Conscripts are newer, 
unskilled members of the clan.  It is their duty to learn about the 
continent of Dominia and its many areas.  They must do their best to 
accumulate knowledge and experience. They must comply with orders 
issued by ANY rank above them.
{x
--{gSoldier {x- Battle-hardened Conscripts are able to advance to this
rank after some time in the field.  The Soldiers are fighters closing 
in on their prime; they should be capable, but not perfect in combat 
situations.  They are expected to aid each other in leveling parties
and help the clan out in any way they can.  To be promoted to this 
rank from Conscript, you must donate 5,000 gold before level 30.  
If you pass level 30, it takes a 10,000 gold donation to be promoted.
{x
--{bGuard{x - Skilled mercenaries reach this rank after hard work 
and determination both in and out of combat. The Guards are 
responsible for defending the glory of Kenshi, and keeping members 
safe.  They are required to defend the castle when it is under attack.
You must be a Guard before you can advance to this rank.  You must be
at least level 40 (pre-remort/reclass) to attain this rank.  It also 
requires a 25,000 gold donation and a pkill ratio of 3:1.
{x
--{rCaptain{x - Long time Guards may reach the rank of Captain after
proving their devotion and ability to lead their fellows. A captain is
a skilled fighter and knowledgeable in all forms of combat. You must
be a Guard before you can advance to this rank. You must be at least 
level 51 (pre-remort/reclass) to attain this rank. It also requires a
35, 000 gold donation and quest given out by a higher rank. 
{x
--{WGeneral{x - The rank below the Deathbringer. There may only be two
Generals at once. The rank of General is for the two most capable 
fighters. The Generals are the ones who know how to change the course
of a battle to suit their side, the ones skilled in the true art of 
combat. To become a General, you must fulfill all of the previous 
requirements, plus one quest from an Elite or Deathbringer.
{x
--{cElite{x - Elites are regarded as the best of the best in the 
general ranks of Kenshi.  Not only are they skilled pkillers, but they
should also be helpful and act as mentors to lower ranking members. 
You must donate an additional 45,000 gold, and be at least level 51
(either remorted or reclassed) to be eligible for this rank.  You must
be a Captain before you can become an Elite, and maintain a 5:1 pkill
ratio. There may only be 3 Elites at anytime.
{x
--{DDeathbringer{x - This is the highest rank. The Deathbringer is the
master of combat. They rally the Mercenaries on during tough battles,
and never falters in his quest to vanquish the enemy. They frequently
behead the leader of the enemies and attaches it to his belt. The rank
of Deathbringer is reserved for the strongest and most proficient
killers in the clan. There can only be 2 Deathbringers at anytime.~
0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting. 

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called 
the 'tick'. Ticks on this mud average 70 seconds of real time, but the 
actual amount varies randomly from 65 seconds to 75 seconds. 

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; 
less often (15 minutes) if someone is. Because areas take so long to reset 
if someone is in the area, it is generally considered to be bad etiquette 
to sleep in an area, or sit in a popular leveling area doing nothing. 

Please avoid this, or else an IMM may be forced to take action, especially 
if you are known to be a repeat offender. Also note that objects lying on 
the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.~

0 HIGH EMBASSAY FROM THE LANDS OF PALANKCAREN (HELP) HELP~
**************************************************
HISTORY 
**************************************************
After a terrible accident, in which he lost all his powers
along with his memory, Avacar came to this land in search
of help. Over the years he slowly relearned his craft, and
his memory returned to him. Once he was strong enough, he
opened a portal back to his homeworld, Palankcaren. There,
he began his training once more as a Valocar, a Guardian
of Balance. He returned to this world on many an occasion,
for help, and to give help in return. Finally he came back
into his true powers, and was whole once again. Unfortunately
there was trouble back in Palankcaren, and a great war
broke out. He asked for help from the people of this land,
and received it. They returned home with him and helped him
win the war. He then stayed in Palankcaren for a year to
help with its reconstruction. Finally, he stood before the
Valocarian High Council, and was given a new task.
 
He was asked to open an embassy to the great world that had
given Palankcaren aid, to help them when they needed it. He
happily agreed. In the city called Stoneridge, he raised his
hands, and from the very earth arose a great castle.
A following of people from both worlds soon began to inhabit
the castle, forming a new guild. It is the first permanent
interdementional joining of efforts, and is called the guild
of the High Embassy of the Lands of Palankcaren, or HELP for
short. 
 
Later Avacar's responsibilities in Palankcaren grew too great
to manage the Embassy by himself. He turned to a trusted friend
who had also aided him in the great war, Cid Orlandu of Bethla.
Avacar appointed him Regent and charged him to see over the
Embassies affairs. High Guardians and Guardians were also
appointed to provide the guild with leadership and council. 
 
HELP now exists to offer assistance to all who need
it, and to entertain the people of both lands.
 
**************************************************
RULES 
**************************************************
1) New Members will be restricted to entrance at level 10,
   and above, no exceptions (other then those who have
   reclass/remorted) will be made. A 5,000 gold entrance
   fee is required to pay the immortals.
2) Non-clanners wishing to enter must note the current leadership,
   the Valocar, the Regent, and the High Guardians. This note must
   contain the reason you wish to join, why you would make a good
   addition to the guild, your race/class and if you are
   remort/reclass. It may also contain, should the applicant wish
   information about his/her RP.
 
3) Members of the guild are still free to follow whatever path they
   so desire, be it one of roleplaying or not. They are members but
   still separate people with separate views and beliefs. Roleplaying
   is suggested, but if your roleplay should counter that which the
   guild follows, there will be consequences. This is to say that
   you can roleplay if you wish or not, follow the guilds roleplay
   or not, but under no circumstances can you roleplay against
   the guild.
 
4) Guild Trade/Charging:
   Each member is responsible for whom they help and what they charge
   for their services. The needs of HELP members, Non-clanners and
   newbies take priority. If a member chooses not to help a particular
   person that is within their right. However any discrimination must
   be based on a just reason (ex. disrespectful/blacklisted).
 
5) Things which members are expected to do:
a) Help anyone levels 1-9 and 10-51 whom are Non-Clanners for no
   charge. An exception to charging NCs may be made for
   Quest/Craft and other high-end eq.
b) Help clan members and loners, for a price.
c) Make the best effort to help out with public guild events
   (such as mini-quests, balls, festivals, etc.) In the cases
   where prizes may be awarded, an Immortal should be sought
   out, to help with this aspect. If this is not possible,
   then money is always an acceptable reward.
d) Donations to help the guild are always accepted from its
   members, and occasionally they may be requested to supply
   a certain amount to help forward the guild in its efforts.
e) Carry out the duties that accompany the higher ranks.
f) Offer assistance to newbies. These people are the neediest,
   and it is important they have a good impression of
   Redemption and NCs.
 
6) There will be a Tribunal, which shall meet on a bi-monthly
   basis to discuss where the guild is going, future events,
   and review the rules. Also, players who have been kicked
   out of the guild, shall have to submit a request to be seen
   before the tribunal to return. The Tribunal may also be
   called upon by the Regent to judge cases of punishment.
   (see Tribunal section for details)
 
7) Members who break the rules may face punishment by the guild
   Leadership, or in serious situations a trial before the
   Tribunal. The Regent has the discretion to suspend members
   in a serious case pending trial.
 
8)  Members are expected to be polite at all times. Talking with
    inappropriate language on in-character channels will not be
    tolerated. Some leeway is given on out-of-character channels,
    but members are still expected to have some good taste.
    Also, acting rudely to other players is greatly frowned upon.
    If someone is acting rudely towards you using the hush command
    is recommended, and if they continue contact the guild
    Leadership or in extreme cases the immortals.
 
9)  We do not tolerate people who become "guests" in our halls.
    Any member who suddenly stops playing with no notice or is
    found to be abusing the guild's regeneration rates will be
    suspended. 
 
10) Members will not slander the names of others, especially other
    members.  If a member has a problem with another member they
    are expected to contact the guild Leadership.
 
11) Only the Regent may speak to the immortals for the guild.
    This includes upgrades and arranging guild events. The only
    exception is for the High Guardians who may, with consent from
    the Regent, add new members to the guild.
 
12) Members are expected to log a minimum of once a week to check for
    important guild notes. An exception will be made for vacations and
    other such occasions, IF the member notifies the Regent of such
    activity.
 
13) HELP membership is exclusive. No HELP member may be part of another
    guild. Members swear HELP as their first loyalty, and must bare the
    guild colors in their RP-titles.
 
14) Members must respond to the guild Census. This Census is conducted
    by the Regent to insure all members listed active are still logging.
    It occurs at random every few months. Members who do not respond
    risk suspension.

RANKS
**************************************************
REGENT AND VALOCAR
The leaders of the guild are the Valocarian Ambassadoriat, the guilds
vital link to Palankcaren, and the Regent, who runs the guild. These
two people are the supreme Ambassadors to Terra and Dominia, and have
the final say in all guild matters. However only the Regent may speak
with the gods on behalf of the guild. The Valocarian Ambassadoriat
is Avacar, Valocar of Palankcaren, and the Regent is Cid Orlandu of Bethla.
HIGH GUARDIANS
Below the Regent are the two High Guardians. These two are the hands of the
Regent. They handle money, equipment, recruiting, and various other tasks.
Contact the High Guardians or the Regent if you wish to join the guild.
 
GUARDIANS
The Guardians of Balance are the true strength of the guild. They keep
the balance of the arcane powers, and decide on guild matters. The
Guardians sit upon the Tribunal. Advancement to Guardian level from
Acolyte is at the discretion of the leadership. See below for information
on Tribunal. Each Guardian represents a portion of the guilds population,
and must consult them before voting on any Tribunal issues.
 
ACOLYTES
The Acolyte is one who is studying to become a Guardian. They must have
shown incredible examples of helpfulness and loyalty to the guild. They
take lower Ambassadors under their wing and show them the ways of our
guild. They act as an example on how to help others and the way our guild
should act. They are also expected to give more to the guild: participating
in more events, and helping to promote more mud-awareness of the guild.
More even than the Guardians, the Acolytes should be seen in the public eye.
 
AMBASSADORS
Finally, upon entrance into the guild are the Ambassadors. These are they
who have come from Palankcaren to help the people of this world. Ambassadors
do all they can to be helpful when they have spare time; gathering and
freely giving information regarding directions to areas when requested,
promoting the guild on all channels, particularly, gossip/music/shout/etc.

0 MERCHANTS OF REDEMPTION GUILD~
Long ago, two sisters were walking the forests when they got lost. 
Unable to find their way home, they asked local travellers which 
direction of their home was. The merchants all smiled, saying they 
had a fee for this information. The prices these travellers requested 
was far more than the sisters had. Finding a friend in the strange new 
world, Aethya, they were given the idea to help people along the road 
in hopes to retrieve enough gold to pay the fee, and find their way 
home. Along the way one of the sisters, Nica, was summoned for a job 
by a handsome man, and quickly fell in love with him. The man,
Kazimieras, fell in love with Nica, and they married. Now, with 
husband, Nica was torn between her family she had missed and the 
love she found. When the time came to get the information, Nica and 
Rendalth decided it best to find a place to sleep, out of the 
wilderness. Brave Daisy built them shelter, which quickly used the 
funds saved to find their way home. From that day on, they knew they 
could not save the funds, needed to go home, without aid. They made
friends among the people they met, and quickly grew farther from 
the home they knew. Years later, Nica died. Gravely stricken by the 
loss of her sister, Rendalth opened the home to those who were close 
to the sisters. Nica's room, still untouched, has been made a shrine 
to those who were close to her throughout the time of her life.
 
To become a Merchant of Redemption you require to:
-Be at least level 10
-Produce the 5000 gold entrance fee on your own

Write a letter to Rendalth and Reme when you complete the obligations
to become a Merchant of Redemption.~
0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down 

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction. They can all be used 
by typing the first letter of each word.~

60 FUCK~
Syntax: FUCK <PLAYER NAME> 

Fuck is an immortal command that will fuck the users terminal up, some more
than others. If you have to use this, use it wisely, as it is only a
temporary fix and not a solution to anything. Fucking a player forces them
to disconnect, as their terminal program will (in theory) not recover
without them disconnecting.~
56 NOQUIT~
Syntax: Noquit <PLAYER NAME> 
This will remove a player's ability to quit from the game. This is to stop
people from making little newbies and spamming the note spool with shitball 
little notes, and other little knickknacks. NOTE: This will not stop a 
player from losing link, or even better, hanging up. 

If this is used for anything more then a deterrent, ie: as a punishment, 
post a note to the immortals. This is normally not serious enough of a 
command to really do anything that special. However, don't abuse this 
power either.~
0 NOQUIT~
If a NO_QUIT flag is added to your playerfile, there is a reason this is
done - mostly because the immortal that is talking to you doesn't want you 
to quit for some reason. You may still lose link or hang up as that is 
your prerogative, but those aren't game commands. 

Also, when pkilling, you will not be able to quit till 5 ticks later.
This is to prevent people from fleeing and quitting, which makes getting
out of a pkill just too damn easy.~
0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target> 

It is easier to cast a spell after you have practiced it. The more you 
practice, the higher chance you have of success when casting. You may 
practice any spell up to 75%. Casting spells costs mana. The mana cost 
decreases as your level increases to a certain extent. 

The <target> is optional. Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat. 

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' <target>. Quoting is optional for single-word 
spells. You can abbreviate the spell name. Example: c heal <self> 
When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully. 

See also the help sections for individual spells.~
0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits 

Typing exits tells you the visible exits of the room you are in. Not all 
exits are visible. You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits. 
(Try to walk in a certain direction and see what you bump into). 

NOTE: Immortals, when typing exit, should always be able to see the room
names in all directions, thanks to 'Holylight'.~
0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get <object>
Syntax: get <object> <container>
Syntax: get all
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put <object> <container>
Syntax: put all.<object> <container> 

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.
Note: Objects with melt_drop will dissolve. 

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse. TAKE is a synonym for get. 

GIVE gives an object or some coins to another character.
Example: give 100 gold <target> 

PUT puts an object into a container. 

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.~
0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory 

EQUIPMENT lists your (worn) equipment (armor, weapons, float and held items). 
INVENTORY lists your (held) inventory.~
54 IMMRULES RULES~
As an Immortal on Redemption you are expected to uphold certain standards.
These standards were put in place in order to maintain the fairness and
integrity of this mud. Failure to uphold the following guidelines will
result in probation, demotion, retirement, or deletion. 

1. Active cheating by IMMs will not be tolerated
This includes everything from setting the stats, hours, hp, etc. of your or 
other players morts; having a trusted or high level imm that Delstar has not
approved; pardoning killers/thieves without cause; snooping players without 
legitimate reasons; giving morts armor, weapons, money, etc.; enchanting or 
restringing mort's items other than as a quest prize; transferring morts in 
order to get them out of trouble or give them an advantage; providing morts 
with game information that gives them an unfair advantage; stating players 
without cause; creating or distributing *super* items or regen rooms; and 
other similar acts which unbalance the game. 

2. Cheating with a mort by a player who also has an IMM is unacceptable
This includes multi-playing, accepting favors from other IMMs, abusing bugs, 
etc. with your mortal characters. Because of the manner in which IMMs are 
structured on Redemption (entering as level 54s) it is imperative that 
players with an IMM be "trustworthy." So if a player who has an IMM cheats
in any manner with his/her mort it will be considered as an action that the 
players IMM will be disciplined for. 

3. Passive cheating is also grounds for punishment
This includes "turning you head" when other morts or IMMs cheat; not 
reporting *super* items, regen rooms, or bugs; and other similar acts of 
"non-action." Part of one's duty as an IMM is to maintain the fairness of 
the mud. By purposefully ignoring cheaters you are neglecting your duty.
This type of neglect is grounds for punishment. 

If you are unsure about the appropriateness of an action contact a higher
level IMM for assistance. In order to make this place enjoyable for
everyone (and allow IMMs to continue to have clanned characters) it is
essential that we follow these standards. If you are currently not in
compliance with *any* of the above standards it is suggested that you
rectify that situation immediately. ~
0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object> 

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory. If both objects are 
weapons, it will report the one with the better average damage. If both 
objects are armor, it will report the one with the better armor class. 

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the 
object you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type. 

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.~
0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue <character> 

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it. If the fight is 
not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can RESCUE 
you. (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work, and costs more 
experience points than fleeing). 

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep 
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time. Your chances of 
making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience. 
(Also see 'NORECALL')~
0 EXAMINE LOOK PEER~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look <object>
Syntax: look <character>
Syntax: look <direction>
Syntax: look <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>
Syntax: peer <direction> 

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see. 

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'. 

PEER allows you too see into the adjoining room.~
0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <mob> command
Syntax: order all command 

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command. The command may have arguments. You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly. 

All charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed). 
Aggressive mobs lose their aggie flag when charmed. 

If you charm a creature and attack it, that will break the charm.

The more charmed creatures under your control, the harder it will be for 
you to exercise your powers over them. In short, the more charmies you
have, the harder it is to control them.~
0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake 

These commands change your position. When you REST or SLEEP, you regenerate
hit points, mana points, and movement points faster. However, you are more 
vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP, you won't hear many things happen. 

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position. You can also WAKE 
other sleeping characters.~
0 GTELL REPLY SAY TELL RETELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say <message>
Syntax: reply <message>
Syntax: tell <character> <message>
Syntax: retell <message>
 
All of these commands send messages to other players. GTELL sends a 
message to all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if 
they are sleeping, stunned or dying. ';' is a synonym for GTELL.
 
SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room. The single quote 
<'> is a synonym for SAY. 
 
TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world. 
 
REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL. REPLY will 
work even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity. 
This is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
 
RETELL sends a message to the last player you sent a TELL to. Like REPLY,
it will work even if you can't see the person you originally sent the TELL to.
The synonym of RETELL is the hyphen '-'.~
0 NOTE 'NOTE WRITE' 'NOTE READ' 'NOTE SYSTEM' 'NOTE UPDATE' 'NOTE FORWARD' 'NOTE REPLY' BOARDS~
Syntax: board [number|name] Shows or changes board.
Syntax: note Reads next note.
Syntax: note read [number] Reads a certain note.
Syntax: note remove <number> Removes a note written by you.
Syntax: note list [number] Shows up to number notes.
Syntax: note write Posts a note.
Syntax: note catchup Marks all notes in this board read.
Syntax: note update Marks all notes on all boards read. 
Syntax: note forward <number> <to> Forwards a note to another player
Syntax: note reply <number> [all] Replies with quoted originial note

These commands are used for the new note system. Instead of just one board, 
there are several, each with its special purpose.  

Changing between the boards is accomplished using the BOARD command. BOARD
without any arguments gives you a list of all boards together with number of
unread message. To change, type BOARD <number> or BOARD <name of the board>. 

To read next unread note, type NOTE. To read a note with a specified number,
type NOTE READ <number>. Typing NOTE while in a board with no unread notes
shifts you to the next board. Note that unlike the standard note system, a 
note has the same number in NOTE LIST and NOTE READ. 

Posting a message is as simple as writing NOTE WRITE. You will be moved into
interactive mode, where all you see are prompts for the fields like 'To:', 
'From:', etc. You will be automatically put AFK while writing a note. 
To see the list of the notes in the current board, type NOTE LIST. Typing 
NOTE LIST <number> will list only <number> of the last notes in the area. 
You can remove your own note by using NOTE REMOVE <number>. Implementors 
may remove other people's notes. Implementors can also select how many days
their note is kept before being purged. Purging happens automatically at
bootup. Purged notes are not deleted, but saved into a file. 

NOTE REPLY <number> will begin a new note with the original note quoted
in it.  Including the argument all will send the note to the all the
recipients of the original note.

To let only immortals see your note, address it to "imm". To let players of
a specific level and above, address it to that level (no other recipients 
may appear in that case). 

This board system was created by Erwin S. Andreasen, erwin@pip.dknet.dk, 
aka Phunk and is freely available. The general outlook was based on Mystic 
Adventure's note system (mud.gel.ulaval.ca 4000).~

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world. To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter. 
{x
GOSSIP and CGOS are variants of SHOUT (without the delay). '.' is a
synonym for GOSSIP. 
{x
YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area. 
{x
MIND is a special channel that connects all slivers to the grand hive.
Essentially, it's a telepathic connection between slivers where they can
talk about things. QUIET mode will not turn off this channel, nor will
simply typing its name. 
{x
Type a channel name by itself to turn it off.~
0 QUIET~
Syntax: quiet 

Quiet mode will turn off all channels for you, thus preventing you from
receiving input from these sources. You can still send messages on these
channels while in QUIET mode, however.~
0 HUSH~
Syntax: hush <player>
{x        hush
{x
Hushing a player will cut off all communication from that player. That is,
you will not hear anything that player has to say (no gossips, emotes,
beeps, etc.)
{x
Typing 'hush' by itself brings up a list of all the people you have hushed.
(see also 'help unhush')~
0 EMOTE PMOTE POSE SOCIAL~
Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose 

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions. Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK
(type socials or help socials for a listing). 

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's
name (i.e. pmote bonks Shemabuku will be read as 'X' bonks you by Shemabuku, 
and as 'X' bonks Shemabuku by everyone else). 

POSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.~
55 SMOTE~
Syntax: smote <action> 

Smote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere 
in the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room. 
(also see 'help emote' and 'social')~
0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear <object>
Syntax: wear all
Syntax: wield <object> 

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start 
using it as equipment. 
HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves. 
WEAR is for armor. WIELD is for weapons. 
WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory. 

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does 
not match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced 
enough to use it properly. 

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.~
0 CREDITS~
Syntax: credits 

This command shows the list of the original Diku Mud implementors. This

mortals to go into, and the suggested levels for those areas. 

COMMANDS shows you all the commands in the game. 

REPORT shows your current statistics to you and also announces them to 
other players in the room. SCORE shows much more detailed statistics to

for example Str: 15(23) means you have a 15 strength from training, but a 
23 strength from other factors (spells or items). 

TIME shows the game time, as well as the time the mud was last started,
and the current local time for the host computer.

OLDSCORE displays many of the same statistic as SCORE does, but in a
different format.~
0 WHO~

Syntax: who <class or race>
Syntax: who <clan name>

remain unseen and won't appear on the WHO. 

WHO without any arguments shows all of the (visible) people currently 
playing. 

With arguments, WHO can show players of certain classes or levels.

that let you type 'who idiot', 'who impotent', 'who ignorant', etc...~
0 MEDITATION FAST HEALING MEDITATE~
Fast healing : After years of fighting, and just as many spent recovering from
the resulting ailments, many being have developed the useful ability to speed
the recovery process! It is claimed that the required rejuvenation period
can be cut nearly in half.
 
Meditation  : The ancient arts of meditation have long been a mystery worthy
of pursuit. Should one find themselves skilful in it's execution, their
spiritual energies will be more vigorously renewed.
 
 ~
0 WHOIS~

0 WHERE SCAN~
Syntax: where
Syntax: where <character> 

WHERE without an argument tells you the location of visible players in the 
same area as you are.

Syntax: help <keyword> 

HELP without any arguments shows a one-page command summary. 

HELP <keyword> shows a page of help on that keyword. The keywords include
all the commands, spells, and skills listed in the game.~
0 DESCRIPTION~
Syntax: description <string>
Syntax: description + <string>
Syntax: description -  

Sets your long description to the given string. If the description string
starts with a '+', the part after the '+' is appended to your current
description, so that you can make multi-line descriptions. You can delete
lines by using description -.~
0 LOOKUP~
Syntax: lookup <player> 

This command allows you to look at another player's description from 
anywhere on the mud.~
0 PASSWORD~
Syntax: password <old-password> <new-password> 

PASSWORD changes your character's password. The first argument must be
your old password. The second argument is your new password.

NOTE: Please write down your new password until you have become accustomed
to typing it.~
0 TITLE~
Syntax: title <string> 

Sets your title to a given string. 

The game supplies a title when your character is created and when you
advance a level. This option can be toggled at any time by typing 
autotitle. You can use TITLE to change your title. 

NOTE: This feature is given to add a more personal touch to your character
and should be used for ROLE-PLAYING. 

IF: If an immortal tells you that your title needs to be changed, then 
change it. There is a damn good reason behind it, normally because another
mortal found it offensive, or it's simply in bad taste.~
0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number> 

WIMPY sets your wimpy value. Your wimpy value cannot be set about 50% of
your total hit points. When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to 
flee. You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. 
has not been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not 
been tripped or bashed by an enemy. 

NOTE: You will ATTEMPT to flee. Wimpy is not a guarantee that you will 
get away safe. 

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit 
points, but setting your wimpy to 1hp will not make you run away when you 
hit 1hp. You will certainly die.~
0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK~

POUR transfers a liquid to a container, or empties one. 

You can also pour from an object into something a character is holding. 
DRINK alone, will make you drink from a fountain or a magical spring.~
0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell <object>
Syntax: value <object> 

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper. 

When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name. So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies). These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you. 
List <name> shows you only objects of that name. 

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper. 

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.~
0 SACRIFICE~
Syntax: sacrifice <object> 

SACRIFICE offers an object to Bosco or Selina, or whichever god you worship,
who may reward you. The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.~
0 SCROLL~
Syntax: scroll
Syntax: scroll <number> 

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page (the 
default is 24 lines). Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disable paging.~
0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP STAFF STAVES POTION SCROLL WAND~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff <potion>
Syntax: recite <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap <target>
Syntax: zap 

-BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff. 

-QUAFF quaffs a magical potion; as opposed to DRINK, which drinks mundane 
liquids. 

-SCROLL recites on self or target, depending on the nature of the scroll.
The scroll must be in your inventory at the time. 

-ZAP zaps a magical wand at a target. If the target is not specified,
and you are fighting someone, then that character is used for a target. 

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP. 

All of these commands use up their objects. Potions and scrolls have a 
single charge. Wands and staves have multiple charges. When a magical 
object has no more charges, it will be consumed. The mage spell 'recharge' 
may be used to recharge items. 

These commands may require an item skill to be successful. See the help 
entries on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character> 
 
CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate. But it tells you
if mobs are very easy to kill or very difficult.
 
The easiest mobs say:
  You can kill him naked and weaponless.
  He is no match for you.
  He looks like an easy kill.
  Is a perfect match!
  Do you feel lucky, punk?
  He laughs at you mercilessly.
  Death will thank you for your gift.
Which is what the hardest mobs say.~
0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character> 

FOLLOW starts you following another character. To stop following anyone 
else, just FOLLOW <yourself>. 

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and

SPLIT commands. If anyone in your group is attacked, you will 
automatically join the fight. This can be toggled using the autoplayerassist
and automobassist toggles, for whether you wish to join in a fight against
a player or a mob, respectively. 

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group. Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you. 

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group. 

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within eight levels of
your own. 

NOFOLLOW will stop people from following you, and you from following people. 

This is also an option to allow people to follow you in the first place, 
and not to be allowed to follow you. 

(also see 'experience')~
0 VISIBLE~
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility or
oculary, making you visible again.~
0 THIEF DEFAULT~
Thieves are a powerful class that hit the hardest at the beginning of     
combat. They're able to steal, sneak and hide from other players easier     
than the rest of all classes with sneak or hide.

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: SAVE 

SAVE saves your character and object. The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving. Typing save
will block all other commands for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generates too much lag). 

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved. 

QUIT leaves the game. You may QUIT anywhere. When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room. 

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just 
one command. Nevertheless, it's a good idea to SAVE before you QUIT. If 
you get into the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some 
other mud that doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it. 

Quitting outside of the town, or designated hall will cause you to lose exp. 
There is no RENT in this mud. Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to 
leave.~
0 RECALL~
Syntax: RECALL 

RECALL prays to a continent's god for miraculous transportation from where 
you are back to the either Temple of Bosco or the Temple of Selina. '/' is 
a synonym for RECALL. 

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for 
fleeing), and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for 
fleeing). This chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% 
recall does not ensure success. 

RECALL costs half of your movement points. 

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms. Characters afflicted 
by a curse may not recall at all. 

(Also see 'help NORECALL')
 
Learned by:
All~
0 NORECALL~
Norecall is a new option that allows you to have the option to RECALL
while link dead and in the middle of combat. Type 'auto' to see if you 
have this off or on. 
(Also see 'help RECALL')~
0 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold> 

SPLIT splits some coins between you and all the members of your group who 
are in the same room as you. It's customary to SPLIT the loot after a kill.

The first argument is the amount of silver the split (0 is acceptable), and 
the second gold (optional). 

Examples:
split 30 --> split 30 silver
split 20 50 --> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split 0 10 --> split 10 gold~
0 STEAL~
Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character> 

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character. 
There are penalties for using STEAL on other players. 

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.~
0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell> 

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you. You can check this anywhere. 

PRACTICE with an argument practices that skill or spell. Your percentage
varies from 1% to 75% that you can adjust by training the skill/spell. You 
may attain 100% by using the skill or spell. You must be at a guild master 
to practice spells and skills. 

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session. The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will have 
each time you gain a level. Unused sessions are saved until you do use 
them.~
0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana quest> 

TRAIN increases one of your attributes. When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several initial 
training sessions. You can increase your attributes by using these 
sessions at a trainer (there are several in town). 

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase mana 
or hp by 10. You receive one session per level. 

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON. WIS gives you more
practices when you gain a level. CON gives you more hit points. In the long
run, your character will be most powerful if you train WIS and CON both 
before practicing or training anything else.~
60 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level> 

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value. It is the only 
way to create new immortal characters within the game. ADVANCE may also be
used to demote characters.~
60 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level> 

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level. This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, etc. You can give more trust to mortal (or immortal) 
characters to give them access to more power without messing up the 
character. You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level. 

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.~
58 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
Syntax: allow <site>
ban <site> <newbies|all|permit>
ban 

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in. BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites. ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner. 

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or 
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidentally lock out too many 
sites with a wildcard. Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.~
59 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
shutdown 

Reboot shuts down the server. When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot. 

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it. WARNING: This command is to never to be used unless
you have an approval from the IMPs.~
56 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
newlock 

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to REDEMPTION. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 51), except for link-dead players who
are returning. Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning. Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the IMPs. 

A god must be at least level 58 to wizlock the game.~
59 DENY~
Syntax: deny <name> 

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable. It may only be removed by editing the file - for this 
reason freeze is usually preferred. Deny is to be used only in an extreme 
situation. If the deny is used, post a penalty note.~
57 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect <name>
disconnect <descriptor number> 

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the 
telnet prompt. This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and 
annoying players. Note that this command is logged, and abusing it will 
cause the 59+'s to ask questions.~
56 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name> 

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than the deny command.

NOTE: Post a penalty note if this command is used.~
56 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
force all <command>
force players <command>
force gods <command> 

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.
Below level 57 (God), force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable. You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example.  

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command. This is 
typically used for 'force all save'. Beware of 'force all drop all', 
as this is blatant misuse and the abuser will be questioned on the matter.  

NOTE: Forcing all to change their 'clean' role-playing style is frowned 
upon. 

FORCE 'players' and FORCE 'gods' does the same as FORCE 'all', but on the 
respective character groups.~
56 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets <host/ip>
        sockets <host/ip> [name]
 
SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in. The number inside bracket is their 
descriptor number, which can be used with the disconnect command to log them
out if they have not yet connected completely.
 
You may now also use the host/ip argument which will show the players by their
host names (ie, somewhere@somehost.com) or as IP's (ie, 123.456.789.0). Using
the IP option is especially useful for creating bans, since it requires an IP
address, not a host name.
 
The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or it can be used to
identify switched imms.~
56 IDENT IDENTIFY~
Syntax: ident <player> 

This command allows you to see the specific account that a player is logged
in from. It is useful for characters that are playing from similar sites,
e.g. freenet6.carleton.ca. By using ident, you can better determine whether
or not they are multi-playing, or what account a spammer is logging in from.~
54 LOAD OLOAD MLOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
load mob 2*<name>
load obj <vnum>
load obj 2*<name> 

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs). The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stating an existing mob or object. 

Load puts objects in your inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they 
are put in the room. Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. 

Old format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, 
new format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(See also clone, vnum, stat). Try to avoid loading objects that are off-
line. There is a reason for it, so make sure they stay that way. 
mload and oload are abbreviations for load mob and lob obj, respectively.~
58 SET~
Syntax: set mob <mobile> <field> <value>
set obj <object> <field> <value>
set room <number> <field> <value>
set skill <char> <name> <rating>
set skill <char> all <rating> 

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.

Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given. Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile. 
(see also 'help string' 'help stat' 'help flag')~
56 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
string mob <field> <string> 

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile. A full list of fields can be viewed by typing 'string obj' or 
'string mob'. Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported, unless you 
sit there and count the spaces. 

Most screens are 80 lines long. So if you do the math, you can have mutli-
line restrings. 

NOTE: Do NOT make strings that are not medieval, e.g. Guns, Bombs, etc.~
56 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL NOTITLE NONOTE~
Syntax: nochannel <character>
noemote <character>
noshout <character>
notell <character>
notitle <character>
nonote <character> 

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.

Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication. 

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music, etc.) on the 
game. Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels. 

Notitle allows you to keep a player from changing his/her title. This is
especially useful if you wish to keep a character from running around with
vulgar titles. Simply restring his/her title to something acceptable then
notitle them. 

Nonote is used to stop a player from abusing the note boards. Such abuses
include repeated spamming of note boards, vulgar notes, etc. 

NOTE: Please post a note when any of these commands are used.~
57 PARDON~
Syntax: pardon <character> killer
pardon <character> thief 

Pardon pardons a player for their crimes. Don't pardon a player unless you
are sure they deserve it.~
54 VAPOURIZE~
Syntax: vapourize <object> 

Totally annihilates the object. Isn't affected by no_purge flags, unlike
it's weaker cousin, Purge.~
54 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
purge <character> 

Purge is used to clean up the world. Purge with no arguments removes all 
the NPC's and objects in the current room. Purge with an argument purges 
one character from anywhere in the world. 

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Tetragon). Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name. 

Purging a player causes the player to quit from the game completely, just
like disconnect, expect for you get a groovy little message.~
56 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
restore room
restore all 

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character. It also heals poison, plague, and blindness. 

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every 
player in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. 

Restore all is only usable by creators and implementors. Restore should be
used sparingly or not at all.~
57 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character>
slay <mob> 

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw. Best not to use 
this command on players if you enjoy being a god. This is a form of a 
strict punishment, and is used for catching multi-players who pass eq from 
one character to the other. PROOF must be needed to use this at anytime. 

NOTE: A penalty note MUST be posted if this command is used on any player
at any time.~
55 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
Syntax: transfer <character>
transfer all
transfer <character> <location>
transfer all <location> 

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 

Note: "Transfer all" is usually a VERY bad idea. ~
0 NAME SNOWY~
Thanks to Snowy for finding us a name for this wonderful mud. It originally
was named 'Nightmares' as a temp name just to give us something to work with.
After going online, our little flower Daisy came up with our story line, and
from there everyone was told to figure out a name that went with it. Well, 
again... thanks Snowy.~
55 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command> 

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given 
location. The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of a mobile,
or as the name of an object. 

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the command, 
and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your location). 

EXAMPLES: 

Syntax: at bosco where
Syntax: at bosco look bosco
Syntax: at bosco look
Syntax: at bosco give diamond bosco~
55 ECHO GECHO PECHO ZECHO~
Syntax: echo <message>
gecho <message>
pecho <character> <message>
zecho <message> 

These commands all perform similar functions. Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it. Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target. Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo. 

PECHO should never be used for imitating another person or player - this 
just causes headaches and trouble. GPECHO is often used to inform mortals 
that a certain Immortal has logged onto the game, and is willing to talk and
help any mortal with a problem. 

ZECHO is used for area echoes. Anyone in the same area as you will see your
echo.~
54 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <mob>
goto <vnum room>
goto <object name> 

Goto takes you to a location. The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object. 

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain god 
level. 

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms. 
(also see 'help violate')~
54 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
wizinvis <level> 

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game. With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily. Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see. 

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will make you invisible to all players 
of a lower level than your invisibility level. It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given. Wizi 60 characters are totally 
invisible.~
54 INCOGNITO~
Snytax: incog <level> 

Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside 
the room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you. It 
takes a level argument similar to wizinvis. People at that level or higher 
can see you regardless of location. 

This is also nice when combined with the WIZIN command. Using Wizin 50 and
INCOG will allow anyone who is level 51 to see you in the room. A level 30
could not. Just a nice little technique.~
54 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory 

Memory reports the size of your mud. 

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and 
objects, not the number of instances currently in the game. 

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings. These strings 
have a maximum limit, which is also shown. 

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks. There is no 
limit on the number and size of these blocks. 

58 and below should not have to worry about this. Yes, you have it, but it 
means nothing to you!~
54 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
vnum <obj or mob> <name>
vnum skill <name> 

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results. Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search. This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name. 
(see also 'help load')~
54 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
stat mob <name>
stat obj <name>
stat room <vnum>
stat clan  

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or 
room within the game. Without a class argument, the command will return a 
object (if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a 
room (if a number is given). 'Stat room' with no argument stats the room you
are standing in. Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto. 
(see also goto, transfer) 

NOTE: If you're going to stat a player, they're also considered to be mobs. 
Syntax: stat mob <player name> 

STAT is NOT to be used by a 55 or below to stat any players. If you are 
found doing so, there better be a good reason, otherwise you will be 
considered cheating, and will be punished in some kind of fashion.~
54 MWHERE OWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>
mwhere
owhere <name> 

MWHERE shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
Mwhere alone will show you where all the players are online and what mobs 
other immortals are in. 

OWHERE shows you where objects in the game can be found, giving you the vnum
of the object. 

There are no commands yet that give you the name of rooms in the game. 

(also see 'help vnum' and 'help load') ~
59 OBJDUMP~
Syntax: objdump <ALL|AREA> <filename> 

ALL: Dumps the information for all the area files loaded in the game 

AREA: Dumps the information for the objects in the area the character is in. 
filename: Name of the file containing the dumped information. 

Fields Format

If set, the letter is there, if not, a '-' appears.
Important flags are in uppercase.
# flag is set, if the object resets on a shopkeeper and the
shopkeeper sells that particural object.

Note that those objects' levels are differently derived.

56 PEACE~
Syntax: peace 

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.~
54 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin <message>
Syntax: pooffout <message> 

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and 'leaves 
in a swirling mist'. You can replace these messages with messages of your 
own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands. These messages MUST 
INCLUDE YOUR NAME somewhere in the string. 

You may also type just POOFIN or POOFOUT just to see what your current 
POOF'S look like. 

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you. 

(see also goto)~
0 NOSNOOP~
Type 'channel' to see if you have the no_snoop flag still. This is ONLY 
given to people with a good reason.~
59 PROTECT~
Syntax: protect <character>

Learned by:
Conjurer~
0 SHADOW~
Syntax: shadow <victim> 

Shadow combines the surprise value of sneak and hide with following
people. Basically, by shadowing a victim, the character can follow
along without being detected by the victim, i.e., the victim does not
get a "so-and-so now follows you" message.~
0 'PRISMATIC SPRAY'~
Syntax: cast 'prismatic spray' <victim> 

Prismatic spray is a powerful attack spell. When cast, it determines 
which elemental form the victim is weak to, and then promptly shoots

0 'RAINBOW BURST'~
Syntax: cast 'rainbow burst' <victim> 

Rainbow burst creates a blast of magical energy that pertains to one of
the elemental forms, which then shoots towards the victim, inflicting
damage. The burst is a random element, so depending on the victim, the
burst may do more damage (because the victim is vulnerable to that
element), or less (because the victim is resistant to that element). 

A more powerful version of this spell is prismatic spray. 

(see 'help prismatic spray')~

0 GIANT~
Giants are the one of the largest races, ranging from 8-11 feet in height.

to lightning.

Syntax: cast 'bark skin'
        cast 'bark skin' <target>

0 ENVENOM~
The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves and
runists, designed to win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than
skill or strength.  Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to
kill the foolish.  
{x
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison 
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates 
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.
{x
(also see 'help poison')~
0 RAY OF TRUTH~
Syntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target> 

This spell may used by angelic players only, and only damage other angelic

This spell may used by demonic players only, and only damage other demonic
opponents. This also causes a player to become demonic slowly. ~

hot, thereby burning the target, before being either thrown off the body
or dropped by the target due to extreme heat. Such items can then be
picked up by other people.~
0 CURSE~
Syntax: cast curse <character>
        cast curse <weapon> 
 
This spell reduces the character's to-hit roll and save versus spells. It 
also renders the character unclean in the eyes of the gods and unable to 
RECALL. Curse may be used to fill equipment with evil power, allowing 
weapons to do more damage to particularly holy opponents.

0 'DISPEL MAGIC' CANCELLATION~
Syntax: cast 'dispel magic' <character>
        cast 'cancellation' <character> 
 
Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target. Dispel magic
has a reduced chance of working, and is considered an attack spell.
Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack. Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells. 
 
The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent 
spells (such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove. Not all spells
may be dispelled, notable examples being poison and plague. 
Being able to be canceled is an option that we allow. NOCAN will toggle
this option on or off. Check your 'auto' command for more details.

0 EARTHQUAKE~
Syntax: cast 'earthquake' 

Earthquake causes the ground itself to shake, causing people to fall to
the ground and be tossed around. Flying creatures are not affected, due
to the fact that they are not on the ground when the earthquake occurs.
However, using this spell causes the whole room to shake, and ALL beings
-- flying or nonflying -- will see this as an act of aggression, and
then attack the caster. (In other words, this is an area attack spell.)~
0 'ENCHANT WEAPON'~
Syntax: cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon> 

This spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing its to-hit and to-dam
bonuses by one or two points. Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the
weapon grows more and more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or
destroyed by the magic. Also, every successful enchant increases the level
of the weapon by one...and there is no turning back.~
0 'ENCHANT ARMOR'~
Syntax: cast 'enchant armor' <armor> 
The enchant armor spell imbues armor with powerful protective magic. It is
not nearly as reliable as enchant weapon, being far more prone to 
destructive effects. Each successful enchant increases the plus of the 
armor by 1 or 2 points, and raises its level by one.~
0 ENERGY DRAIN MANA DRAIN~
Syntax: cast 'energy drain' <target>
Syntax: cast 'mana drain' <target>
 
 
Energy drain is used to suck the targets stamina clear out of them. However,
it is such a violent spell that the victim is physically wounded at the same
time.
 
 
Mana drain, like it's energy sucking cousin, inflicts injury when brought to
bear upon a target; the main difference is that instead of draining stamina,
this spell relieves the target of it's magical potency.
 ~
0 'FAERIE FIRE'~
Syntax: cast 'faerie fire' <victim> 

When this spell is cast, the victim suddenly glows with a faint pink
aura. The purpose of this pink aura is twofold: first, the victim
cannot hide, due to the glowing pinkness around him, and second, he
becomes easier to hit.~

Syntax: cast 'mass invis' 

The INVIS spell makes the target character invisible. Invisible characters
will become visible when they attack. It may also be cast on an object
to render the object invisible. 

The MASS INVIS spell makes all characters in the room invisible, including
the caster. 

To counter act this spell, type 'visible' and it will remove any skill or

0 SLEEP~
Syntax: cast sleep <victim> 

This spell puts its victim to sleep. The amount of 'ticks' is dependant
on the level of the caster. You will remain asleep until either the
spell wears off or you are somehow hurt. 

While slept, anyone may cast any maladiction spell onto you. This does not
include 'poison' and 'plague' due to its nature of shivering and suffering.~

0 'SUMMON LORD'~
Syntax: cast 'summon lord' <name> 

Summon lord is an extremely powerful spell, allowing the caster to call
forth a demon lord from the netherworld. The downside, however, is that
it's EXTREMELY hard to control the summoned lord; worse yet, the lord
has a possibility to break the pentagram that holds him. 

There are six known demon lords in the realms. However, what their names
are remains a mystery, and can only be found through research...

0 'FOURTH ATTACK'~
Fourth attack allows the character to have the possibility of getting
yet another attack in combat. Perfect fourth attack does not guarantee
four attacks per round. Only very specialized warriors have access to
this skill.~
0 NOSUMMON~
NOSUMMON is also a toggle flag that you may or may not want to turn off. For
anyone who is in a clan, checking this every now and then with the command

Slivers can trade in their ability and get a new one once they've matured.

To do this, you must "train sliver" at a trainer. The process of trading in
a sliver power costs 3 trains, and there's no guarantee you'll get a sliver
type you'll want.~
0 BREATH~

See help <race> for more info.~
0 HATCHLING DRAGON~
These are our special addition to the mud, and are very powerful in their
own rights. When you choose the class Hatchling, you will be a small 
dragon without the ability to fly, and are vulnerable to certain weapon 
types. At level 10 a hatchling will turn into a random color dragon. When 
this happens, the player will receive more skills and spells that only 
their color may attain. 

Dragons are the largest of all the races, ranging from 9 to 12 feet in 
height. They are the most powerful of all the races, and are very durable. 
The ability to make them fly at any given moment as well as special spells 
make them rather hard to play, but are worth it in the long run. They 
receive many skills and spell which make their starting creation points 
(cps) seem rather minor. They take a serious player with a large amount of 
time and effort. 

Warning: With each color dragon there is a resistance spell and a 
vulnerable spell. A red dragon is vulnerable to frost, and is resistant to 
fire. The rest of the colors you must find out for yourself. 

(20 creation points)~
0 DWARF~
Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans. Known for their foul temper, glowing 
red eyes and great resistance to spells, they make an interesting character 
to play. Dwarves have a high strength and constitution. Their poor 
dexterity is well made up by their other resistances, such as disease and 
poison. 

(8 creation points)~
0 HUMAN~
Humans are the most common race in this world, and make up the majority of 
the heroes. Although they have no special talents like the other races, 
they are more versatile then any other race, and are well-suited for all 
classes. They also get to train their primary stats higher then all others. 

(0 creation points)~
0 ELF~
Elves are slightly taller then humans, but their body is much lighter,
making them more nimble and thus harder to hit.  Their lack of strength and
stamina are made up for by ability to 'sneak' and their glowing red eyes. 
Elves have a strong hold over the power of magic and mind, due to their
magical nature.  Because of their excellent agility, they are difficult to
bash.  {x 
{x
(8 creation points)~
0 TROLL~
Trolls are a medium-sized, stocky race thought to have been dwarves
corrupted by the taint of chaos when the great magic first spread
throughout the land. They possess a surprising strength for their
average-shaped bodies, although they lack the strategic and long-range
planning abilities of the other races. As part of their transformation,
they have acquired an improved immune system, thus making them able to
heal faster with regeneration, along with a resistance to foul disease. As
a trade-off, however, fire disrupts their healing abilities. Trolls live 
in tribes, and while the tribes have differences in the way of beliefs and
customs, all tribes favor the axe as their totem weapon. 

(6 creation points)~
0 GARGOYLE~
Gargoyles are a race of xenophobic, protective beings that hide away in
the mountains on Dominia. They are ferocious fighters, relying more on
their powers and size than sneaking up on their prey. Gargoyles have a
special kinship with the earth, as they can invoke the element to become
living stone warriors. These large, clumsy but wise beings have a
severe reliance on magic, giving them a weaker immune system than would be
expected for one of their kind. A gargoyle's favored tactic is to dive
from above on land-dwelling beings, slashing at them with long
polearm-like weapons that they so heavily favor.
{x
(12 creation points)~
0 SLIVER~
Slivers are an insect like breed which likes to hunt in packs. Slivers are 
appoximatly the same physical size as humans, but their mandibles extend to
form long jagged arms that they flail at their opponents in hand to hand 
combat. 

(12 creation points) 

Slivers come with hand to hand naturally, and when reaching level 10, mature
into an adult sliver form. These forms give the sliver a specific ability 
to be shared with its fellow slivers when grouped. The sliver doesn't 
acquire its own ability, but acquires the ability of every other mature 
sliver in its group. A mature sliver can randomly 'trade' his ability for
for a different one at a trainer. The sliver abilities are as follows: 

Vorlath Sliver Affects mana by +25
Merlin Sliver Affects mana by +30
Magical Sliver Affects mana by +50
Samite Sliver Affects hit points by +25
Pain Sliver Affects hit points by +30

0 CLAN CLANS~
A clan is a collection of players, united to follow and further a common
cause. Each clan has rules and regulations that they must follow. These
rules are enforced by the leader - for the most part. If for some reason 
an immortal must interfere, that immortal must be a level 58+ or someone 
with a 58+ permission.
 
To find out more about certain clans, and there beliefs, type 'help <clan 
name>'. This should list their purpose and reason for existing. There are 
five main clans that exist right now. They are JUSTICE, SEEKERS, KENSHI, 
VENARI, and KINDRED. There may be more clans if some mortal or immortal 
comes up with a reasonable idea and purpose.
 
Joining a clan is a dangerous step for anyone. Many players (pkillers) are 
born to kill and torture other clanners. When in the pkilling system, you 
may kill anyone except for non-clanned characters. Switching from one clan 
to another is allowed. Remember that a clanner must have the received the 
leader's or recruiter's permission to join. 
 
Clan leaders are level 53, and recruiters are level 52. If you want your
spells to be a little more powerful, then get involved in your clan. A
player can not have more than one character serving as leaders or 
recruiters.
 
In order for a clan mutiny to occur, one must contact a level 58+ for a
legal mutiny to happen. If not, the mutiny will be consider illegal and
non-official.
 
IMPORTANT: You cannot join the pkill system if you didn't decide to at 
creation. If you wish to leave the pkill system you can retire.
 
(Also see 'help loner' 'help mutiny' 'help retire')~
10 MUTINY~
In order for a clan mutiny to occur, one must contact a level 58+ for a
legal mutiny to happen. If not, the mutiny will be consider illegal and
non-official. The mutiny will follow these guidelines:
{x
1. The challenger can not be more than 10 levels below that of the clan 
leader and must supply the imms with the names of two level 35+ 
(or remort/reclass) clan members who support the mutiny in the note 
declaring the mutiny.  The challenger must not have a character who is a 
leader or recruiter in another clan at the time the note is written.
{x
2. The mutiny will not be official until the imms have received written
confirmation by the supporters that they support the mutiny AND have
posted a note to the entire clan informing them of the mutiny attempt.
{x
3. The current leader has to accept. If not, then the leadership is then
given to the challenger, and the leader is then removed from the clan.
If there is more than one leader, then one memeber of the leadership
team must decide to face the challenge.
{x
4. The mutiny will occur at the earliest possible date that can be arranged
among the leader, the challenger, and a level 58+ IMM. (For example,
a fight will not be postponed to permit a character time to gain levels.) 
If the mutiny does not occur within 2 weeks of the IMM annoucement, the
player who is delaying the fight will be declared the loser and be subject
to all the penalties of a loss.  (Under extreme circumstances the player
may petition a level 59+ IMM for an extension beyond 2 weeks.)
{x
5. Once a mutiny has been declared all recruiting must be halted. The 
challenger and his supporters can not be removed from clan or killed and 
looted or stolen from by his/her clan mates.  Any clan mates who engage in 
such behavior will be lonered.
{x
6. If the challenger or his supporters are recruiters they will be allowed 
to retain their position and level. If the challenger or his supporters 
kills or attacks a clan member he or she will be lonered and the mutiny 
will be called off (this does not include participating in duels with 
clanmates who agreed to the duel or killing a clanmate in an IMM run 
tourney). A challenger and his supporters are expected to continue to 
abide by the rules of the clan at the time of the mutiny.  If they break 
clan rules, they will be put in 1212 until the mutiny is held.
{x
7. If the current leader does accept the two will duel. If the challenger 
loses s/he will be deleted. If the the challenger wins then the leader
or leadership team will be lonered and the challenger will become leader.
{x
8. The leader may appoint someone from the clan to fight for her/him,
if the appointee agrees.  The appointee can not be an alternate character
of the leader.  If the challenger loses s/he must delete, if the appointee 
loses the leader must leave the clan and the challenger becomes leader. An 
appointee must have been a member of the clan at the time when the mutiny 
was declared. 
{x
9. A duel is a one-on-one fight, involving no wands, staffs, scrolls, 
potions, charged craft items, throwing objects, or pills (besides for 
spelling up before the fight). The only charmies allowed are troll 
arms/legs since the player can not control the making of those. The 
fight will be held in a safe room and the loser will get his/her corpse 
back. No looting will be allowed.
{x
10. No outside interference will be allowed during the mutiny (ie no one 
from outside the 2 person fight can cast voodoo on one of the fighting
players, etc.).  In addition, no one can be grouped with a player in a
mutiny fight. Anyone players engaged in such activity will be frozen or
punished in a similarly harsh manner.
{x
11. Both the challenger and the leader will be cancelled prior to the fight
after this all spells have been removed, they will be restored and 
allowed to spell up with whatever means they have avalible, such as
potions and wands. They will NOT be allowed to worship before a fight.
Anyone in a mutiny fight caught with a worship spell on them will be
automatically disqualified.  Once they have spelled up, the players will 
be restored and the fight will commence.
{x
12. The fight must start within 10 seconds of the imm saying go. If you 
are the cause of the delay, you will be found in default, and judged the 
loser, lag is the only exception to this. No room affects may be in effect 
at the start of the fight. The fight may be stopped through the use of 
various of skills, however, it must be underway again in due time, which 
is no greater than 2 ticks. The imm will provide warnings before the person 
who stopped the fight is declared the loser.
{x
13. Anything not explicitly disallowed is allowed, any "questionable" things 
which have been forgotten here should be taken up with the immortal running 
the mutiny. 
{x
14. Once a successful mutiny occurs, the new leader will have 24 hours to
make changes in clan membership. During this period another mutiny can
not be called. 
{x
15.  Before declaring the mutiny, the mutineer must loner all their alts
from other clans, as no leadership position may have alts elsewhere, and 
a show of loyalty to the clan they wish to lead is required.

0 PEEK~
Syntax: Peek <character> 

Peek is very similar to the ability of look, but with this skill you may 
look at someone's inventory. Only rogues can peek inside a person's 
containers. There is a slight chance that you may be caught when peeking at 
them. ~
54 CHARTER FERRY~
Syntax: charter 
Getting to the other continent would be a hassle if it werent't for the 
ferries that run. You can charter the ferry for a small amount of gold.
When you charter, you are immediately transported onto the ferry, where
you will spend a few (game) hours, until you come to the next continent.

You must be at a ferrymaster in order to charter the ferry, and you have
to be at the ferrymaster at the correct times. See your local ferrymaster
for details.~
0 LORE~
Syntax: lore <object> 

Lore is a separate skill from look. Sometimes you may wish to look at
items, and sometimes you may just want to lore it. Lore tells you a lot
of information about an object that looking at it does not reveal. This 
does the same thing as the identification spell, but costs no mana.~
0 TOWN HOMES GUILDS TOWNHOMES~
Town homes are available to anyone. Only non-clanners may obtain a
private room in their home. A non-clanner's private room will allow only
the owner and his/her spouse (spouse must also be a non-clanner)entry.
A non-clanner's home can be a combination of public and private rooms.
 
Clan members (including loners) may also purchase a home. All rooms in
the clanner's home will be public rooms.
 
The option of upgrading mana or hp regen rates is available only to
non-clanners. Before upgrading the hp or mana regen rates in a room, the
room must be private. Homes will all be _no mob_ (meaning you cannot 
bring or summon a mob into your home). Homes will not have a _no where_ 
flag. If you are home, people will know it.
 
All town homes will be located in Stoneridge or Stoneridge II on the 
continent of Terra. Guilds may buy a 2-room vacation home in Shandalar 
(only after purchasing a guild in Stoneridge).

0 Fellowship Guild~
At first there were two, a gigantic warrior and an elven conjurer. Itay was
the name of the warrior, as quick with his tounge as he is with his sword.
The elf was Karmon, an impatient conjurer who was known for his hot temper,
and deadly crushing hand.
 
They have roamed to lands of Terra and Dominia in search for adventure, but
monsters and princesses were not they only things they have found, they have
gained something more vaulable than gold and jewels, more important than
royal blood - They have gained friends.
 
The first one was Mooshi, a happy white dragon who loved nature, and with his
skills and magic could do wonderful things. The second was Karon, a second
conjurer who has studied the art of sorcery.
 
As time passes, many friends were gained, Itay has attained the rank of a Lord
that was given to him by Avacar himself, Valocar of Palankcaren. Karmon became
a Duke after he had given up his immortality, and gained much strength. The two
decided they must find a place to rest, both were tired and old, and wanted no
more than rest (and sexual pleasures, but that is not available on this land).
 
So the two have built up a mighty mansion and summoned all their friends.
They are now known as The Fellowship, a group of dedicated mates with no

leader. A team who is mighty for friendship, and not because of weapons.
The Mansion still has many rooms unoccupied, waiting for the new mates
to arrive and house it.
 
The Rules:
 
1) A member of the Fellowship is his own master. He may choose his own
   policy regarding helping any indevidual, and for which price - this
   is the not of the Fellowship's concerns should one decideds not to
   be helpful.
 
2) Rule 1 applies to members of the Fellowship themselves. One member
   is not required to help another. Help will usually be handed, as
   all members are friends and close ones.
 
3) In order to be accepted, one must be recognized by Either the Lord
   ord the Duke as a friend. Friendship does not start in a note, but
   in assistance and trust. Therefore no one can join the Fellowship
   instantly - it is a long and hard journy to be favored in the eyes
   of the Duke and Lord.
 
4) In order to be accepted, 5,000 gold are not enough. Maintence of the
   mansion is quite expensive, and so the fee is set by either the Duke
   or the Lord
 
5) If these rules seem very difficult, you are right ;)
 
The Lord and Duke.
Contact Mooshi or Karmon if you want to join this guild.~

56 LAG~
Syntax: lag <character> 

This is a very interesting way of punishing those who disobey the laws of

was given control of the Western half of the world and Selina ruled the 
Eastern half. A great body of water separated these lands and allowed Bosco
and Selina to develop their empires without interference. 

On Dominia Selina's power created a colony of man-like insects. These 
beings, which she named Slivers, paid homage to her and grew strong and 
prosperous. While on Terra, Bosco's generous nature spawned a race of 
dragons whose fierce and powerful skills refused to be contained. 

Eventually the dragon race learned of the Eastern continent and vowed to 
rule it. They invaded Dominia to ravage and destroy the inhabitants and 
gain power over the land. After many bloody victories, it appeared the 
dragons would dominate the lives of Selina's followers, killing those who 
would not obey their laws. 

Selina despaired, for she did not have enough power to defeat the dragon 
horde alone. It was then she was joined by Gargnath, a mighty troll wizard,
and Lawrygould, the King of Dominia. Together they constructed a great wall
around the coastal city of Shandalar from within which they could repel the
invaders.  

Guided by the wisdom of Gargnath and the intelligence of Lawrygould, Selina 
used her magic to unite the trolls and the slivers into a mighty army. 
Through great effort, such as few have ever seen before, the army of Dominia
routed the Dragon horde from their continent. They killed the most ruthless
and left only a small group of dragons to limp defeated back across the sea. 

The battle cost Selina much energy and weakened her substantially. She was 
laid to rest in a crypt only to be disturbed if Dominia was ever again 
threatened by the rule of Dragons. The trolls returned to their forest 
village and the slivers again prospered. The resulting peace lasted for 
decades. 

Unfortunately, efforts are now being made by many races to re-establish 
contact between the continents. King Lawrygould, fearing another invasion, 
hired the remains of the clan Pragmati to live on his shores and dedicate 
themselves to slaying Dragons. 

"Soon the Dragons will return, and if we are not prepared we will be at 
their mercy! Non-Dragons Unite! Throw off the chains of oppression! They 
are numerous and our strong are too few. We must focus our efforts on their
destruction, or face our own." -- King Lawrygould at the establishment of 
Clan Venari. 

Not all the inhabitants agree, however. Some feel that the reconnecting of 
the continents will be the long sought opportunity to make amends for 
ancient wrongs. These people, of both worlds, want trade and prosperity for
all.

0 APPRAISE~
Syntax: appraise <item>
 
Red dragons like nothing so much as treasure, and are notorious for
collecting huge hoards. With the appraise skill, a red dragon can
increase the value of item at the risk of destroying it. 
 
Some items may not be able to be appraised.

Red Dragon~
0 DARKNESS~
Syntax: cast 'darkness'
 
Black dragons are able to use their magic to summon a cloud of total
darkness over a room. This darkness will overwhelm any known light
sources and even infravision will not help. Only creatures with dark
vision will be able to function normally within this cloud. All
creatures in the room will be stricken effectively blind as long as
they stay in the room. 
 
Learned by:
Black Dragon~
0 LAIR~
Syntax: lair
 
Blue dragons are extremely self-reliant, rarely needing to visit the
confines of civilization. During their travels they may take up a
lair. The dragon may only have one lair at a time, but while within
their lair the blue dragon will be hard to find and enjoy a small
increase in the healing rate.

Green dragons are able to emit a highly caustic gas which can make a room
so toxic anyone who breathes it for long will suffer painful lung damage
and a nausea which inhibits their fighting skills. Long term exposure
brings with it a chance of being poisoned.

0 STORY~
In a simpler time, the citizens of Midgaard and the immortals of Valhalla
lived in peace under the benevolent rule of Bosco. A kind and fair leader,
he was beloved by all his subjects. During Bosco's reign he had 5 children,
each of them very different. First there was Taelisan, who was withdrawn, 
hard, cold and calculating; next was Carnas, who lusted for total control of
everything; then there was Bhaal, an indivdualist who sought his own path; 
next was Gabriel, who strove for goodness in all he did; the youngest was 
Chain, who sought to level all hierarchy. As Bosco grew old and weak, his 
children began to fight among themselves for the leadership of Terra. Not 
content to just wreak the heavens their squabbles, the children began to 
recruit mortals to back their claims. 

Eventually, the golden doors of Valhalla were forced open and chaos spilled 
across the region. Soon the streets of Midgaard were stained with blood. 
Using the last of his strength, Bosco stripped his children of most of their
powers and banished them and their followers from Midgaard. Those faithful 
mortals who had scorned the violence and refused to take sides mourned the 
loss of Bosco. These steadfast souls called on immortals from another realm
to restore order to their land. Answering the call came Delstar, Maclav, 
Daisy, and Gothic who pledged to uphold the ideals of Bosco and bring 
redemption to Terra. 

However, order was not easily restored and the first victim of the chaos was
the great immortal Gothic, who fell from the heavens and was lost to the 
world. The next to be claimed was Taelisan, who found himself tottering on 
the edge on insanity and surrounded by the memories of his dead father. He 
passed down leadership of Pragmati and retreated from the cares of the land.
Then the garden of Eden was surrounded by darkness and overthrown by the 
strength of a clan of Kindreds. Most recently, the clan of Eclipse fell by
the wayside because of weak leadership and a new clan by the name of Harpers
has arisen. 

A new danger now threatens the shores of Terra. A continent named Dominia
has been rediscovered across the Dragon Sea. Not only do the inhabitants of
Dominia scorn the name of Bosco, but they also despise his most favored 
race-- the dragon. They have recruited the remains of the Pragmati to live
on their land and repel any invaders.  

To be continued....

0 'TRUE SIGHT'~

0 PENALTY GUIDLINES PUNISHMENTS~
The following presents some guidelines used by immortals when assigning 
punishments for any infraction of the rules (see HELP RULES). Actual 
punishments used are entirely up to the discretion of the immortal. It 
is recommended that repeat offenses use subsequent punishments. The idea
being, 3 strikes and you're out.

Ignorance of the rules is no excuse and will NOT mean a lesser 
punishment. If you believe your punishment is unwarranted or overly
severe, put together a convincing case and e-mail to

0 BLACK GREEN BLUE RED WHITE DRAGON~
Black Dragons are known for their ability to be invisible in a single room    
at any given moment. Their breath is very powerful in nature, and is one of    
a kind. No other race may be able to cast this spell.        

Blue Dragons are more self-reliant. They're not known for hanging around    
cities for supplies. Their breath spell is a more damaging one than all the    
rest as it not only causes damage, but may also destroy certain armor types.  

Green Dragons are not something you wish to have attack you when they're    
prepared for combat. Their purpose in life is to poison their foes with 
as many toxic substances as they can.        

Red Dragons are fierce and greedy creatures. Their breath may cause you to    
lose your bearing for a small amount of time. Their love for money goes    
beyond any other creature in the land. What belongs to them, belongs to them.   

White Dragons have been known to live in extremely cold regions. They enjoy    
helping other characters. To see a white dragon is considered very lucky,
and can affect your life on a very fundamental level.

0 'CLASS HELP'~
Redemption has the following classes:        

MAGE       Mages are magic beings. Power flows through them, and hits
           others as easily as breathing.  They have the greatest
           diversity of spells.      
INVOKER    Similar to mages, but have the ability to form the very
 	   essence of magic into whatever they want. Their power
 	   lies in the combat-oriented magics.        
CONJURER   These are nasty people to tick off. They are able to summon
           unknown creatures to this world that will obey every command
           that their masters give.        
ENCHANTER  They are not a combat-oriented profession, but rather, they
 	   have the ability to imbue items with special abilities.     
WARRIOR    Just brut(al) force. They are mostly pure muscle, and they stand
           mostly for justice, though warriors can fall victim to the power
           of evil and cause chaos in the world.        
PALADIN    Similar to warriors, but without a few skills that only a warrior
           can master. They make up for it, however, with their spell
           casting ability, generally in the area of healing.           
RANGER     Rangers are a combination of a warrior and a druid in one, but 
           also make excellent archers. However, they do have a few 
           of their own skills that no other class may possess.
THIEF      Thieves are greedy and will trick you into many things. They hit
           hard for most of a fight, but near the end their ability to
           finish someone off leaves a little to be desired. They will steal
           and pillage anything they can get their hands on.        
CLERIC     These are the priests of the land. Their blessings and overall
           magic abilities make them useful. They are powerful healers.      
DRUID      Druids are at one with nature, and their skills and spells
           reflect this. They will fight for the right for others to live,
           and when they are pissed off... well, just beware the power of
           Mother Nature herself.
RUNIST     Runists learned their strange type of magic from Kirre travellers,
           and specialize in using magical symbols to cause a variety of effects,
           including powering their equipment, protecting their bodies, and

1 MACROBASICS~
The basics:   A macro is essentially an extended alias with variables.  
Unlike aliases, macros support multiple commands which are separated by 
semi-colons, and  they can call other macros (including themselves).  
When a macro is  running, any commands typed in by the player will take 
precedence over  commands from the macro definition.  By typing the name
of the macro, all the commands stores within the macro will execute
themselves, in order.  

MACRO LIST lists your existing macros and their definitions.
    
MACRO DEFINE <NAME> <SUBSTITUTION> defines "NAME" to mean "SUBSTITUTION".  
SUBSTITUTION is any command or sequence of commands that is valid on the mud,
including calls to aliases and other macros and definitions of aliases and  
macros.  A macro definition can contain multiple commands, up to a maximum  
of 9, separated by semi-colons (';').  Commands can also contain variables,  
a maximum of 10 per macro, identified as %0 to %9.  Normally, to activate
a macro, you simply type its name. However, any arguments typed after the
name of the macro will fill the variables, from %0 to %9.

Examples:  
To define a macro called 'food' which recalls you and goes to the baker to  
buy 10 big pot pies, you would enter:      

     macro define food recall; s; s; w; n; buy 10*pie    
then, any time you were out of food and wanted to get some, you could simply  
type 'food', and you would recall and go buy some pies.    

To define a simple grats for people who've leveled, you could:      
      macro define congrat grats Congratulations, %0, on your level!!!    

to grats KillerBob on his level, you would simply      
      congrat KillerBob    

and get      
       grats Congratulations, KillerBob, on your level!!!      

MACRO UNDEFINE <NAME> deletes the macro "NAME".
    
MACRO UNDEFINE ALL deletes all of your macros.    

MACRO TRACE <NAME> prints the execution path of the macro "name".  
The execution path is the set of commands which are executed when the macro  
<NAME> is run.  The specified macro is not run, and variable substitutions  
are not made, when this command is used.    

MACRO JOIN <MACRO 1> <MACRO 2> joins MACRO 2 to MACRO 1 and undefines 
MACRO 2.    

MACRO REMOVE <NAME> <X> <Y> deletes commands from macro <NAME>.  
The commands numbered <x> to <y> (inclusive) are removed from the definition  
of macro <NAME>.    

MACRO REMOVE <NAME> <X> removes command <X> from the macro's command list.    

MACRO REMOVE <NAME> FIRST removes the first command from the definition of  
macro <NAME>.    

MACRO REMOVE <NAME> LAST removes the last command from the definition of  
macro <NAME>.    

MACRO RENAME <OLD NAME> <NEW NAME> renames macro <OLD NAME> to <NEW NAME>.    

MACRO RENAMEU <OLD NAME> <NEW NAME> same as rename, but also updates any  
macros you have defined calling <OLD NAME> to reflect this change.    

MACRO INSERT <NAME> <X> <COMMANDS> inserts command(s) <COMMANDS> into macro  
<NAME> before position <X>.    

MACRO INSERT <NAME> FIRST <COMMANDS> inserts command(s) <COMMANDS> into  
macro <NAME> before the first command in the macro.    

MACRO INSERT <NAME> LAST <COMMANDS> inserts command(s) <COMMANDS> into 
macro <NAME> before the last command in the macro.    

MACRO INSERT <NAME> <COMMANDS> inserts command(s) <COMMANDS> into macro  
<NAME> before the first command in the macro.  It's the same as MACRO  
INSERT <NAME> FIRST <COMMANDS>.    

MACRO APPEND <NAME> <X> <COMMANDS> appends command(s) <COMMANDS> into macro  
<NAME> after position <X>.    

MACRO APPEND <NAME> FIRST <COMMANDS> appends command(s) <COMMANDS> into  
macro <NAME> after the first command in the macro.    

MACRO APPEND <NAME> LAST <COMMANDS> appends command(s) <COMMANDS> into macro  
<NAME> after the last command in the macro.    

MACRO APPEND <NAME> <COMMANDS> appends command(s) <COMMANDS> into macro  
<NAME> after the last command in the macro.  It's the same as MACRO APPEND  
<NAME> LAST <COMMANDS>.    

MACRO REPLACE <NAME> <X> <Y> <COMMANDS> replaces commands numbered <X>  
through <Y> with <COMMANDS>.  Multiple commands can replace single commands.    

MACRO REPLACE <NAME> <X> <COMMANDS> replaces command number <X> with  
<COMMANDS>.  Multiple commands can replace single commands.    

MACRO REPLACE <NAME> FIRST <COMMANDS> replaces the first command in macro  
<NAME> with <COMMANDS>.    

MACRO REPLACE <NAME> LAST <COMMANDS> replaces the last command in macro  
<NAME> with <COMMANDS>.    

MACRO KILL <NAME> kills <NAME> if it's running.    
MACRO KILL ALL kills all running macros.    

MACRO RUNNING lists all running macros.  ~

1 RACE REMORTS REMORTING 'RACE REMORT'~
Syntax: remort <sub-race>
 
Once you reach level 51 you can remort your character and pick a new
sub-race which will provide you with new skills and spells, but also
new limitations.
 
In order to remort you must have a certain number of quest points.  To
see the number of QP you need type "remort".
 
Remorting removes all the equipment you are wearing and puts it in your
inventory.  It sets the character back to level 1 and puts you at
(20hp 100mana 50mv).  All your old and new skills/spells get set back
to 1% (except weapon that gets set to 40%).  You automatically get the
main weapon for your class type.  Your hours are put back to 0, wimpy
is set to 0, and you are given 3 trains and 5 practices.  You get to keep
your clan affiliation and can be pkilled at level 1.  If you have a killer
or thief flag at the time, it will be removed.  Also any skills or spells
your mort gained after creation gets added to the remorts CP.
 
 
The sub-races you can choose from include:
Red Dragon: Ruby or Fire
Blue Dragon: Sapphire or Sky
Green Dragon: Emerald or Earth
White Dragon: Pearl or Mist
Black Dragon: Onyx or Shadow
Elves: Forest or Drow
Dwarves: Mountain or Grey
Giant: Hill or Cave
Human: Doppleganger or Medusa
Troll: Two-Headed or Spectral
Sliver: Stinging or Abyssal
Gargoyle: Sentinel or Haunting
Kirre: Dark or Sabre
Marid: Nereid or Befouler

1 RUBY RED DRAGON REMORT~
All dragon remorts have a better affinity with their bodies.  They are now  
able to use their tails in attacks.  Their scales have hardened on their  
hands, feet, and legs making it unnecessary to wear equipment any  
longer on those areas.  This ups their natural AC and DAM rates.
   
Ruby dragons are known to be wise and regal, but also snobbish.  They are  
proud of their skill to "thrust" an extra attack if successful at parry.   
They also have the spell "loneliness" which can be cast on an opponent to  
make the where command useless.  ~
1 FIRE RED DRAGON REMORT~
All dragon remorts have a better affinity with their bodies.  They are now  
able to use their tails in attacks.  Their scales have hardened on their  
hands, feet, and legs making it unnecessary to wear equipment any  
longer on those areas.  This ups their natural AC and DAM rates.   

Fire dragons are greedy, vain, and confident.  They have an extra attack   
skill that allows them to "dragon bite" their opponents if dodge is  
successful.  They also have the ability to lower their armor class by 
casting the spell of "scalemail".  ~
1 SAPPHIRE BLUE DRAGON REMORT~
All dragon remorts have a better affinity with their bodies.  They are now  
able to use their tails in attacks.  Their scales have hardened on their  
hands, feet, and legs making it unnecessary to wear equipment any  
longer on those areas.  This ups their natural AC and DAM rates.   

Sapphire dragons are usually peaceful and not militant.  They can avoid  
fights by casting "cone of fear" which forces their enemy to flee.  They  
also have gained a "gemology" skill, which allows them to convert gems   
into throwing objects.  ~
1 SKY BLUE DRAGON REMORT~
All dragon remorts have a better affinity with their bodies.  They are now

noontime hours. 
{x
Spectral trolls are permanently occularied. They also have the ability
to call spirits from another plane and leave them as "familiar" guards

appearance they can put "fear" into their victims, which limits their 
ability to do damage. ~

1 CRAFT ITEM WORKSHOP~
Syntax: craft <all the keywords of the item to be crafted)

The art of modifying and customizing equipment has finally
resurfaced among the races of Terra and Dominia. With
sufficient magical power, level, and the right items, you
are able to combine them into new items.
 
Everyone receives the craft item skill at level 30. Items 
which may form part of a crafted item will say so when lored 
or IDed.  There will also be clues to locating the ingred-
ients in the areas where the items are located.

You will need to locate a workshop flagged room in order
to craft any items. It will also cost mana, and use up
the components you've found. If you try to craft an item
and fail, you will not be able to attempt crafting again for
quite some time afterwards.

Learned by:
All~
54 CRAFT WORKSHOP~
1. All the formulas for every crafted item are kept in a list
that is loaded and saved by the mud. They are NOT attached
to your area, so don't edit/delete other people's formulas, or
use their items in your formulas without permission.
 
2. The command to access the formula editing facilities is
"workshop" you can abreviate this to work. All commands to modify
crafted item formulas will start with this command.
 
3. To add a crafted item, you will need to make the items
normally using OLC. Any item which can be produced MUST have
the "crafted" wear flag. Any items which are part of a crafted
item must have the "incomplete" wear flag. Other than that,
the items can be anything at all you want.
 
4. Once the items are made using OLC, you can add a new
formula to the list by typing "workshop new <vnum>" where the
vnum is the vnum of the object that will be produced, ie the
actual crafted item.
 
5. You can add components or modify existing ones using
workshop part <crafted index> <part vnum> <quantity>
So if you wanted to add 30 diamonds (3377) to a stygis
sword (33110) to form a diamond blade (8389) you would
type the following:
workshop new 8389
workshop part 25 33110 1
worshop part 25 3377 30
 
6. You can view all the formulas by typing "workshop list".
You can also filter the list by the names of the crafted
items as well. eg workshop list sword. If you are unhappy
with your crafted item, you can also delete the entire
item by typing "workshop delete <crafted item vnum>" to remove
the formula from the list. You CANNOT remove individual
components of a formula once they are added without removing
the entire item.
 
7. I also suggest making most craft items and/or components
no_locate to add to their mystery. I also think most of the
formulas should be kept secret from mortals and revealed
gradually through new areas, quest awards and experimentation.
This is currently a level 59+ skill.~

Syntax: clanreport  clear (for level 59+ IMMs only)
 
Clanreport is a command which allows you to see particular pkill information
about each clan. It is broken down into how many pkills a clan has achieved,
how many times members have been pkilled, as well as who the best (and worst)
pkiller is.

No arguments after the command will show you every clan, whereas putting a clan
afterward will show you that particular clan's information.

Clanreport clear will reset the report form.~

0 WORSHIP~
Syntax: worship <cr>         - Gives you your worship stats.         
        worship <god name>   - Sets the God you wish to worship.         
        worship none         - Sacrifice for silver again.         
        worship claim        - Claim your deity favors.            
        worship cost         - Lists the Gods and their favors. 
 
Worship lets you offer sacrifices to Gods of your choice.  Each time you 
sacrifice a corpse, you gain deity points which you can use to claim your 
God's favors. If you change Gods you LOSE the deity points you have 
accumulated up until then.  
 
The favors are as follows:
 
pacifism:  While under the effect of "pacifism", you are safe from any 
player's attacks.  KILLERS and THIEVES can walk around without worries of 
other players. Same goes for any clanner actually.  pacifism = I'm safe 
from players. For nonclanners, pacifism allows you to take less
damage from mobs you are fighting. 
 
injustice:  injustice lets you attack players without getting a (KILLER) 
flag.  The level restrictions are the same mind you.  Also, people can 
attack you without getting a KILLER flag (This is so that after you hit 
them, their hit doesn't cause them to get a flag). For nonclanners,
this effect grants you extra gold from the mobs you kill.
 
gullivers travel: Allows you to "recall dominia" or  "recall terra".  This 
is the only inter-continental ability we will grant.
 
detect all:  The name says it all.  invis, hide, sneak, you name it.  The 
only thing safe from detect all is wizi and incog. 
 
surge:  extends the life of your spells.  Basically, while you are under 
the effect of surge, only the ticks for "surge" go down in the "affect" of 
your character.

0 BUNNIES BUNNY~
The Bunnies of Redemption.  Many decades ago, I was born. I was a poor defenseless 
little bunny girl, with no friends, no family and no real hope in life. Then one 
day as I traveled through a forest, or meadow.  I forget now it has been so long, 
I met some other rabbits who were like myself, helpful, but lonely and looking for 
a family. So we all joined together and built a big burrow up in the Stoneridgian 
forest to stay warm on those cold winter nights, and we also found that we could 
help others better this way.  We got a better nights rest because we felt protected 
and we always had enough to eat because of our healthy vegetable garden.  

 We, the Bunnies of Redemption always welcome others into our burrow if they: 
- Have something to offer, the 5K if costs to move you in would be nice. 
- Are willing to help, especially other bunnies. 
- Vow never to kill a rabbit, hare or bunny including with charmies.  
  This includes the Killer Bunny in the Zoo. 
- Vow never to eat any part of a rabbit, hare or bunny. 
- And you gotta be very very very cute to be a bunny! ~

since the last time they logged in was.  f the leader has not logged in
3+ months, the position and all responsibilities falls upon the
recruiter(s) to decide who the new leader should be.
Imms would only get involved if the recruiter(s) ask us to do so.
 
-If both the Leader and Recruiter(s) have abandoned the guild, then
the remaining guild memebers decide who the new Leader should be.
If they decide to disband the guild, the room regen rates are
removed (if any), and the rooms are open to the public - clanners
and nonclanners alike.

treasure above all else. He acquired it though any means
he could, without heeding the consequences nor those that
his actions would affect. In time, he acquired a fortune
unrivaled by any other. His treasure was so large that
he was forced to hollow out an entire mountain just to
house it. This mountain became known as Lonely Mountain.
{x
Many hundreds of years passed and the great Smauge grew
old. He was no longer physically capable of defending his
treasure from the thieving hands of men as he once did. He
became fearful that someone might steal his treasure and
decided to cast a mighty spell. Using ancient magics, long
forgot by man, he caused the earth to swallow the mountain.
Not long after, Smauge died a peaceful death, reassured by
the knowledge that his treasure was safe.
{x
Many years later, Smauge's great grandson, Reptile, was
not so peaceful. Like Smauge, Reptile also desired treasure
above all else. He knew of the greatest treasure ever
collected, but also knew that it was now beyond his grasp.
He searched the world for treasure with all of his strength
for many years. He realized quickly that he would never
match his great grandfather's hoard.
{x
Reptile decided to begin recruiting people, treasure
hunters, who shared in his greed. Two of these treasure
hunters were chosen as his princes. They were known as
Galiant and Acaykath. Together, they amassed wealth and
collected treasures until they had too much to store. The
three of them, all experienced conjurers, began to prepare
a great feat of magic. They gathered themselves in
Stoneridge and began to chant. After several hours, there
was a sound like continuous thunder that shook the very
foundations of the earth. A great chasm opened, and out of
it arose Reptile's greatest desire, Lonely Mountain.
{x
They combined their treasure with that of Smauge, but
it was not enough. They began to recruit others to join
them in their quest for ultimate wealth. Others joined,
and their stores of gold increased. It was still not
enough. Reptile and Galiant travelled across the great
waters to search for opportunities to acquire more wealth
on Dominia. They failed to anticipate Acaykath's greed.
{x
As months went by and Reptile did not return, Acaykath
began to slowly grow more and more greedy. With no one to
counter him, Acaykath claimed the entire guild as his own
treasure, crowning himself king in place of Reptile.
{x
When Reptile returned, alone, he discovered the
treachery, but was to late to wrest control back from
Acaykath. He was forced accept Acaykath as King of the
guild and to lower himself to the position of high prince.
He told Acaykath of the prospects that had been discovered
on dominia. They had created a theatre where people would
bring gold in order to see stories enacted using magic.
This became the Treasure Hunter's home on Dominia.
{x
Since that time, Acaykath has ruled the Treasure Hunter
guild and led them on the path of acquiring treasure with
those who have gained his favour ruling under him as
princes.

{x
4. Players Council is empowered to be able to remove members from 
{x   their ranks should the reason come up. This can only be done with a

0 RUNIST BASICS RUNIST DEFAULT~
The runist considers flashy magic to be crude and basic.
Striving for a ideal unintelligible to most magic users,
the runist focuses on using magic indirectly in order to
empower themselves and their equipment to supernatural
levels.

The runist's skills include using magical tattoos and 
runes for both offense and defense to supplement their
combat abilities. An interesting feature of this class
is how their powers will change over time as their
tattoos and runes fade away and are replaced by others.
The runist is a distantly related subclass of the thief
sharing only a few basic characteristics.

RUNIST BASICS:
Spear: Runists favour long pole weapons.

RUNIST DEFAULT:
Dodge: The act of not being there when it counts.
Parry: Simply blocking the attacks of your opponent.
Dirt Kicking: Sneaky yet effective way to blind foes.
Second Attack: The chance at a second attack each round.
Trip: Keeping foes off balance.
Meditation: Concentrating helps replenish mana stores.

Tattoo Magic: Tattoos replace equipment and offer 
advantages.
Rune Magic: Runes for empowering equipment and protecting 
rooms.
Illusion Magic: Indirect magic common to most runists.~
0 RUNIST ZEALOT~
The Zealot is a maniac with no fear of death. Relishing the
thrill of combat, an injured Zealot's rage knows no bounds.
Empowered with magical tattoos and armed to the teeth with
runic magic, the Zealot is a fearsome figure. During combat,
the zealot often loses control and finds themselves unable
to determine when to fight and when to flee.
 
-Martial Arts: Addition hand to hand training, including parry 
and stun.
-Ignore Wounds: Take less damage when fighting multiple opponents.
-Push: The muscle to choose your own battleground.
-Symbol: A sigil of warding which can protect your equipment.
-Zeal: Become more powerful as your hp decreases.
-Hurl: Throw weapons at distant targets.
-Death Rune: Your death could prove fatal to your killer.~
0 RUNIST PSION~
The Psion continues to develope their own runic skills in 
seclusion. They have learned how to channel their energies 
into blades of solid energy, and how to focus the energy 
contained within their own bodies more effectively. This 
heavy reliance of spiritual energy means the psion will 
become less effective as his mana stores are depleted.

-Jump: A long distance leap across two rooms.
-Push: The muscle to choose your own battleground.
-Symbol: A sigil of warding which can protect your equipment.
-Iron Vigil: Survive for long periods without food or water.
-Soul Blade: Creates a solid blade of spiritual energy.
-Fury: Able to charge up their attacks for a short time.
-Trance: Able to charge up magical resistance for a short time.~
0 PAINT TATTOO LESSER GREATER POWER~
syntax: paint lesser, paint greater, paint power
 
Tattoos are usable only by runists. When you use the appropriate paint
skill and have an equipment slot free, it will become occupied by a
tattoo. Tattoos can appear on the following equipment slots:
Torso, head, arms, right wrist, left wrist. When you paint a tattoo,
the first empty slot from among those listed will be tattooed.
 
Tattoos essentially replace equipment in those slots. Tattoos are 
similar to regular equipment, but they cannot be removed, even with
death. They are semi-permanent, lasting several hours real time
before crumbling into dust.
 
Almost all tattoos affect your stats like equipment does, however the
bonuses are totally random. The number of bonuses a tattoo can grant is
related to your level. Sometimes you will have tattoos substantially
more useful than regular equipment, but sometimes they be mostly useless.
You can only remove tattoos by using the "destroy tattoo" spell, or
waiting for them to disappear.
 
The differences between the tattoo types breaks down as follows:
 
paint lesser: Has the greatest number of bonuses, however each one is small.
paint greater: Fewer number of bonuses, but each bonus is much greater.
paint power: Fewest number of bonuses, can grant an additional power that
is unique to tattoos. See "help power tattoo".
 
Learned by:
Runist~
0 POWER TATTOO~
These are the highest level tattoos for runists. In addition to granting
bonuses on attributes like all tattoos, these tattoos also give an additional
bonus that cannot be acquired in any other way. Each power tattoo can have
at most one of these bonuses.

-A chance that each spell cast will not cost mana, and instead use a 
 smaller amount of movement to power the spell.
-Tattoo animates as a charmed creature relative to your level. You can have
 multiple animated tattoos. They are animated by typing "animate".
-Increases the healing rate of the runist no matter where she goes.
-Increases the mana regeneration rate of the runist no matter where 
 she goes.
-Regain some hp for each kill you make.
-Regain some mana for each kill you make.
-Gain more deity points for each sacrifice.
-Reduces all damage taken from physical sources.
-Reduces all damage taken from magical sources.
-Grants temporarily knowledge of any spell you don't already know.
-Raises the effectiveness of all your spells.

In general, all bonuses from tattoos are cumulative and stack. Having
multiples of the same power tattoo can be extremely useful.~
0 FIRE RUNE~
syntax: cast 'fire rune'

The runist is able to scribe a fiery rune on the exits of the current
room. Anyone entering the room will be engulfed in flames. Any number
of victims may be burned by the fire rune, however they can only be
burned once per tick for as long as the fire rune persists. Anyone
within the grouping range of the runist is vulnerable to this rune.
 
Learned by:
Runist~
0 SHACKLE RUNE~
The runist can fashion mystical chains across the exits of the current
room. Anyone in the runist's grouping range who enters the room will
become entangled in the shackles. The shackles are short lived, but
they make movememt extremely difficult. The shackles will work on
everyone who passes by, but the affects are not cumulative.
 
Learned by:
Runist~
0 ALARM RUNE~
The runist can leave a personalized marking on a room. Anyone who
passes by will disturb the pattern and the runist will be notified.
This useful rune can be used defensively or offensively to keep
track of people. You may only place one alarm rune at a time.
 
Learned by:
Runist~
0 BURST RUNE~
The runist is able to empower their weapons with magical symbols.
The burst rune is the most powerful symbol a runist has, allowing
their weapons to discharge violent blasts of magical energy.

The magical is difficult to control, and the runist has no control
over which effect the rune will produce, but all of the common
magical attacks are available. This rune may be combined with a 
blade rune to provide a runist with devastatingly powerful weapons.
Only runists may wield weapons bearing a burst rune.
Possible effects:
Acid Blast
Flamestrike
Tsunami
Blast of Rot
Lightning Bolt
Ice Bolt
 
Learned by:
Runist~
0 BLADE RUNE~
The runist is able to empower their weapons with magical symbols.
The blade rune provides a variety of unique modifiers on weapons
which substantially improve the combat abilities of runists.

The magic is difficult to control, and the runist is unable to
control which effect his blade rune will have. This rune may be 
combined with a burst rune to provide a runist with devastatingly 
powerful weapons. Only runists may wield weapons bearing a blade 
rune.

Possible effects:
Shielding: Greatly boosts armor class.
Accuracy: Hits are more difficult to avoid.
Slaying: Boosts damage roll and becomes vorpal.
Speed: Strikes more often.
Deflection: Blocks incoming attacks.
Piercing: Greatly boosts hit roll.
 
Learned by:
Runist~
0 BALANCE RUNE~
The runist is able to counteract the effects of magical enchantments
using this rune. When cast on a weapon or armor, the balance rune 
will cancel out the destructive forces of a failed enchantment, 
allowing weapons and armor to receive additional enchantments. Balance 
runes are severely limited. Each casting, there is a chance the balancing
forces will destroy the weapon as surely as a failed enchant, as well,
the balance rune will persist for only a very short time.
 
Learned by:
Runist~
0 WIZARD MARK~
Each soul has a unique aura, and runists are no exception. Runists
are able to design a unique and easily visible mark to place upon
their equipment. Such benefits are very minor, the item will lose
any no_locate flags, and will now bear the runist's name. Any items
which bear a wizard mark are distinctly noticeable by their runic
aura. A wizard mark is a permanent thing, and once placed, cannot
be removed in any way. The rune is powerful enough to stop non-runist 
from using any wizard marked eq.
 
Learned by:
Runist~
0 SOUL RUNE~
Each soul has a unique aura, and runists are no exception. As an
extension of the power of a wizard mark, high level runists are
able to bind pieces of equipment directly to their souls. Such
equipment appears ghostly and transparent, and is extremely
difficult to seperate from the runist. The soul rune is powerful
enough to persist even through death, allowing runists to carry
on selective possessions into their next life.
 
Learned by:
Runist~
0 DESTROY TATTOO~
Magical tattoos created by runists are extremely durable and tough.
No regular magic can seperate them from their wearer, not even
death. The highest level runists possess sufficient skill in 
tattoo magic to be able to forcibly remove tattoos from 
their own bodies. The arts of tattooing have unpredictable results,
and it may frequently be desirable to remove an unwanted tattoo 
in order to replace it with something better. Destroying tattoos
will not always work, and when successful, the runist will suffer
fierce burns as the tattoo inks are purged from his skin.
 
Learned by:
Runist~
0 SOUL BLADE~
Psions are capable of focusing their inner powers into solid blades
of energy which they can wield as weapons. Like many runist
abilities, soul blades are far from predictable. The soul blade
formed will assume a shape from among the weapons the user is
most competent with, and at an appropriate level of power. The
magical enhancements on a soul blade are random and dependent on
the level of the psion. These weapons are powerful enough to
outshine most conventional weaponry, however they are temporary
and randomly generated.
Known by:
Psion~
0 FURY~
Psions are able to channel their inner powers through their own
muscles, pushing their bodies beyond normal limits. Fury is a
charged-up skill, the psion must reuse it several times for the
fury to increase more and more. The psion is only able to use
their fury this way in short bursts, but the results are quite
remarkable. All the psion's hits will deal substantially more
damage while under the effect of fury.

Known by:
Psion~
0 TRANCE~
Similar to Fury, the Psion is able to channel their energy 
defensively as well. Using their energy to shield their minds 
by entering a trance during combat, the psion can ignore most 
types of magical damage. This is a charge-up skill that can be 
used repeatedly for increased effect. Such a deep trance cannot 
be maintained for long.

Known by:
Psion~
0 HURL~
Exerting a frightening level of concentration, the Zealot is 
able to maintain a deadly level of accuracy even a long ranges. 
This skill is identical to throw, however it has a range of 
greater than 1 room. You must be holding a throwing weapon in 
order to use this skill.

Known by:
Zealot~
0 ZEAL~
The Zealot has the unique ability to channel the pain of his 
injuries back into his own attacks. Rather than growing weaker 
as he nears death, the Zealot grows more and more powerful with 
each injury inflicted.

Learned by:
Zealot~
0 DEATH RUNE~
The many runes learned by Runists are powerful spells bound 
into inanimate objects, and cannot directly target living things. 
This also holds true for the Death Rune, until of course the 
Zealot's body is no longer animated by his spirit. As a Zealots 
lifeless body falls to the ground, the Death Rune will finally 
take effect, blasting the Zealot's slayer with a force akin to 
a Meteor Swarm.

Zealot~
0 PRICES UPGRADES~
These are the costs in gold for upgrading a clan hall.  You can not add
more than 50 rooms or items to a clan hall.  Should you wish to uprade,
please see an immortal and have correct change.
*** ALL transactions are to be done with ATM cards ***
 
Clan Hall Upgrades:
 
+10% hp Upgrades:          - 25000, max 300%
+10% mana upgrade          - 25000, max 300%
add a store item to store  - item cost * 1000, round to nearest hundred
                             for example: sanctuary potion (costs 8000
                             silver) 80* 1000= 80000 gold (you can only
                             add items to your store which are currently
                             for sale).  No item will sell for less than
                             1k gold.
add a non-store item       - item cost * 1000 * (level+all stats), round
                             to nearest hundred.  Also, for items with a
                             value less than 10 gold, the value will assume
                            to be 10 gold.  For example: onyx key: value
                             is 0, gives 2 stats, and is level 3.  So:

-1 ROM~
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993, 
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM. ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released, and
various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under a new
management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.  The following people contributed
to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:  

Socials                    -- Kelsey and Liralen 
                              And Delstar, Galad, Gothic, and Daisy  
New, Improved Valhalla     -- Liralen and Daisy  
Puff's code                -- Seth  
Maps and map shop          -- Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)  
Nirvana zone               -- Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)  
Mob Factory                -- Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, 
                              mobiles rewritten by Alander)  
Geographically correct 
Midgaard (tm)              -- Alander  
Ideas and playtesting      -- Thousands of dedicated mudders around the 
                              world  
Beta testing               -- Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil
                              all helped with bug reports and suggestions,
                              saving a lot of headaches  
New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator 
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files. 

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead SLED, and the release 
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there. Additional code was
written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions and 
ideas from the Merc list were used. Portions of Rusty's code from Moosehead 
also remain.  The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions
with Gabrielle (my wife) and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened. In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and wiznet are
largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.  Changes to the standard diku mob 
and object format, as well as the changes to Merc 2.1 source code, were done 
by Alander over many a late night of hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.  (My
apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list.)~
-1 GOD IMMORTAL~
'Immortal' (often known as 'imms') refers to players who have reached the
highest attainable levels in the game. Here, anyone of level 54 or higher is an 
'immortal.' Immortals are capable of exceeding the usual game rules, in more 
drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase; examples range from teleportation 
and invisibility to mortal sight to creation of objects, removal of a player's 
privileges (channels, ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability 
to promote players to immortality.  

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally) a 
carefully-chosen and policed group. An absolute rule of immortal behavior is 
that no immortal can aid or assist any player without explicit permission from 
the higher ranks; in other words, please don't ask an immortal to help you kill 
a mob, gather EQ, etc., or you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, 
or referred to this file.  The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons 
for their existence, are topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD 
forums, and are fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous 
hypocrisies. :) ~
0 COLOUR COLOR ANSI~
Syntax: colour or color      Toggles colour mode on/off
 
You may also talk in colour by inserting the colour code for the desired
colour into the text. Color codes are in the form of a left-handed brace '{{'{'
followed by a letter. The colour codes are as follows:
 
{r{{r     red                     {R{{R     bright red
{c{{c     cyan                    {C{{C     bright cyan
{g{{g     green                   {G{{G     bright green
{y{{y     yellow                  {Y{{Y     bright yellow
{b{{b     blue                    {B{{B     bright blue
{w{{w     white                   {W{{W     grey
{m{{m     magenta                 {M{{M     bright magenta
{D{{D     black
{x{{x     Will reset the colour to your client's default.
{u{{u{x     {uUnderlines{x the text until it reaches another color code.
When using colour, it looks better if you finish the line with whatever colour
it would normally be in, such as a gossip, the colour is cyan, so:
                         {cLope gossips '{ghello, {yworld{c'{x
looks better than:
                         {cLope gossips '{ghello, {yworld'{x

54 JOBS~
Level:(54) Builder

This level has only one purpose: to build! We ask that while you are logged 
in you actively work on your area. Whether that is writing descriptions, 
gathering information, etc. While you are a level 54, we ask that you remain
INCOG from mortals most of the time.  You should NOT accept moneyfrom mortals 
for upgrades and can ONLY run triviaquests. Once your area is ready for testing, 
it will be checked out by a level 58+ IMM. If it is found acceptable you can 
begin area testing with mortals.  

Level:(55) Retired 

This level is given to retired immortals, or immortals that have been  granted 
a hero's sanction. They have no real purpose here, other then be  friendly.
Don't cheat or kill players, and you will do just fine.  

Level:(56) Demigod

You have two main roles: area building and quest running. You also have 
permission to do reimbursements after crashes, but be skeptical and don't just 
hand out every piece of gear. We suggest limiting reimbursements to 5 items and 
a diamond, and make sure that you do not load things which are a higher level 
than the mortal. Vnum and stat are useful for this. You can draft other gods to 
help you run a quest, and please note that  quests should NOT have huge rewards 
the main point should be to have fun.   Also do not run quests or give prizes 
which you do not have the power to  complete or give (i.e. pardons or sets). 
You have no business trying to  enforce rules -- the most you should do to a
player is a NOCHANNEL or  similar light punishment.  

Level:(57-58) God and Deity

These immortals can run quests just like lower gods, and it's nice to do 
reimbursements too. However, the main role of a God is keeping the peace. Gods 
can enforce (but not create rules), using the various NOTELL-class commands, as 
well as deny, purge, freeze, and ban (but be careful with these commands!) Gods 
are expected to help make the mud run more smoothly;  power trips are strictly 
verbatim. Area building is very nice to still do,  as we would love to have all 
the areas we can. And whenever possible, please assist the lower level gods 
with their questions, as they're not experienced as you. Many of you also have
specific duties; it is your responsibility to keep up with your jobs.  

Level: (59) Creator

This level is here to moderate the lower level immortals, and take care of the 
mortal situations that the 60's don't want to deal with. These immortals are 
also assigned specific duties and they should be consulted with questions 
concerning problems in these areas.

Not fulfilling the roles of your office can result in demotion or deletion.

(Also see 'help duty') ~
-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~
Player killing and player stealing are allowed to all clan members
(including loners), provided the victim is within 8 levels of the character
and is also in a clan.  This will flag you as a "killer" or "thief",
allowing any character (up to 16 levels above you) to attack, and also
provoking action from the city guard and other law-enforcing mobs.  ~

1.  Once you join the IMMs your character can not return to clanner
    life if for trany reason you leave IMMship.
     
2.  Any active cheating by your IMM is grounds for deletion of
    the IMM and any mortal character helped by the IMM.
    
3.  Any cheating by the mortal of a character that owns an imm, 
    is grounds to have the imm deleted and the mortal punished.
           
4.  Any passive cheating (not reporting known bugs, the cheating
    of other mortals or immortals, etc.) is grounds to lose your
    IMM. (See 'help immrules' for further info on the above rules.)
         
5.  Do not reveal code information to the mortals.  While you can talk
    in general terms about how a skill or spell is suppose to work,
    specific information about damage done, how the spell is coded, or
    how damage is assigned, etc., should not to be revealed.
         
6.  IMMs are to present a united front before the mortals.  That means
    that if for any reason you do not agree with a decision made the
    the IMM leadership team, you can post your displeasure to your
    fellow IMMs but do NOT involve the mortals in the disagreement.
            
7.  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level IMM.  They have
    received their position for a reason, try to respect that.
            
8.  Just because you are an IMM does not mean that you are better than
    the rest of the mud.  Do NOT powertrip, do NOT put down mortals over
    public channels, do NOT goad mortals into fights.

14. If you punish a mortal you MUST tell that mortal who you are either 
    face to face, or in a note.  They have a right to know which IMM is 
    punishing them.
             
15. If you punish a mortal write a penalty note.  If you do not post a
    penalty note than your punishment will be overturned.
        
16. All areas built for Redemption are joint property of the builder
    and the mud.  While the builder may attain copies of his/her area,
    the mud's IMPs retain the right to modify/retain the area if the
    builder for any reason stops being an IMM or leaves the mud.
           
17. If you stop playing the mud, do not accomplish anything as an IMM,

18. If you step down from your IMM, you will have to reapply for a
    position.  You will not be automatically reinstated. ~

(see also: HELP PUNISHMENTS)~
58 NPC 'NON-PLAYER CHARACTER'~
Immortals who have the set ability now have the power to set certain mobs
to NPCs. What this does is turns a mobile into a "character" that will
show up on the who list. For example, if you were to set the pile of gold
coins to an NPC, it would show up as:[30  Quest NPC]. The pile of gold coins
on the who list.

The purpose of this is manifold:
* special RP-intensive quests involving NPC mobs
* "mercenary"-style mobiles for players to group with
* keen thing to do

You can restring an NPC mob just like you would do any other mob. 

It's preferable for the imm who creates the NPC mob to switch into the mob
and role-play as that being.

To create/toggle an NPC: set mob <mob name> npc <some number>

This will toggle the NPC status of the mobile. You can put any number into
the <some number> field, it's irrelevant.~
0 SUICIDE DELETE~
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use. This command must be typed twice to delete a character, 
and you cannot be forced to delete. Typing delete with an argument will return
your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the first delete.
To delete a character here on Redemption you have to use your password to do it. 

Immortals can not see your password.  

Example: Delete <mypassword> <enter>          
         Delete <mypassword> <enter>  

This will get rid of any unwanted characters, as long as your password is used 
after the command delete.~
56 RENAME~
Syntax: rename <old name> <new name>
Rename allows an IMM to change unacceptable character names.  Please check
first with the player to find out what new name s/he would like.  Also 
refrain from renaming older high level characters. 
Level 56 imms can only rename people level 10 and under.
Higher level imms can rename anyone.~
0 HEALER~
The healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals. Some
services are still free to players of level 10 or below, however. To see a full 
listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence.To receive 
healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'. ~
0 AUCTION BID BET~
Syntax: auction                 Displays information on the item currently up
                                for auction. Turns on auction channel if it is
                                off.
Syntax: auction <object>        Places an item up for auction. Turns on auction
                                channel if it is off.
Syntax: auction bid <gold>      Places a bid on the item up for auction.
Syntax: auction bet <gold>      Places a bid on the item up for auction. 
Syntax: auction stop            Command used by immortals to stop a suspicious
                                use of the auction.(See also: 'help RULES)
Syntax: noauction               Toggles the auction channel on and off.
 
Auction is an automated mercantile system through which you can offer and  sell
items over the mud to the highest bidder. If no bidder makes an offer, the
item will be returned to you and you can put it up for auction at a later time.
 
Trash items cannot be auctioned. This is to prevent people from bidding large
amounts of gold on an empty bank note, for example.   Remember that an immortal
can confiscate your item at any time. If the auction channel is being abused,
this can and may happen.  Noauction will toggle the auction channel on/off for
you. Typing "auction" while an auction is underway will display information on
the object being  offered and the latest bid received.~
-1 GAIN~
The gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has been 
found. The following options can be used with gain:  
gain list:    lists all groups and skills that can be learned 
gain points:  lowers your creation points by 1 (costs two sessions) 
gain <name>:  adds a skill or skill group, at the listed cost 
gain convert: turns 10 practices into one training session  

Gain uses training sessions, not practices. (see 'help train') 

Gained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total 
number of creation points, until you remort or reclass. 

(see remort/reclass, 'help creation points')~
54 CLONE~
Syntax:   clone obj <object>   
          clone mob <mobile>   
          clone <name>  

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile. The level of item or  mobile 
that may be cloned depends on your level. The target object or mob  must be in 
the same room as you, or in your possession. Strung and set  information is 
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and  container contents or 
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high  for you to clone. Strung 
extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.  

CLONE mob 20*snails  : Will create 20 snails + 1 for the original 
CLONE obj 20*diamond : Will create 20 diamonds + 1 for the original  

Please use these commands rather than loading the item over and over again. 
Remember that your commands are logged, and we don't want to create *too* much 
spam for the 59s and 60s, right? ~
0 SKILLS SPELLS~

you, this command is available to you before level 25. It drops you to the 
status of non-clanner... for a price. Should you wish to use it, the  cost to

-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~
The Redemption skill system allows you to fully customize your new 
character, making him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But 
beware, the skills you pick at character creation are the only skills you 
will ever learn.  Skills are paid for with creation points, and the more
creation points you have, the harder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, 
higher-cost skills are harder to practice.
{x
Skill groups are like package deals for characters - sets of skills or 
spells that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit. There 
is a default skill group for each class, which can be chosen for a balanced 
selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.
The experience breakdown is as follows: 
{x
points   exp/level     points   exp/level
40        1000         90        6000
50        1500         100       8000
60        2000         110      12000
70        3000         120      16000 
80        4000         130      24000
{x
The table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.
It should also be noted that the table listed reflects the exp/level for
humans. Each race/class combo will vary from this table, but the basic
premise is followed.~
-1 BASICS 'ROM BASICS'~
The basic skills:

Every character starts with two skill groups, one for their class and a 
default set that all characters receive.  The default skills are:
recall          essential escape skill (see 'help recall')
scrolls         reading of scrolls and other magical volumes

-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP MARKSMANSHIP~
Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and
determines how well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The
weaponsmaster group provides talent in all weapons (save exotics and
marksmanship), from chair legs to halberds.  If the character has the parry
skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.

0 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.

and clerics are good at it.

0 DEMONOLOGY~
One of the greater feats that invokers have been able to accomplish
is the ability to summon forth demons from the lower planes of the
netherworld. This spell group, named demonology by its forerunners,
lets the invoker call forth demons to do his bidding -- providing he
has a proper pentagram set forth, and the demon in question has not

-1 BASH~
The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon
is generally not a wise idea.~
-1 BERSERK~
Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane 
rage in combat. Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a 
huge surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserking fighters are more resistant to the effects of magic.~
0 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~
Considered by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors, rangers thieves
and runists may learn this skill.  ~
-1 DISARM~
Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon. The best possible chance of disarming occurs when 
you are skilled at both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented 
thieves and warriors may learn this skill.~
0 DODGE~
In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving 
the character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target. Any class may learn dodging.

Learned by:
All~
-1 ENHANCED DAMAGE 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
ENHANCED DAMAGE
Warriors, thieves, druids and clerics can become skilled enough in combat
that they are able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced
damage is checked for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance
of receiving a bonus is very low indeed. ~
1 AURORA~
Syntax: cast aurora
 
Pearl dragons have the ability to make their friendly and charming
personalities benefit themselves or those around them. By casting
aurora on someone, even mother nature herself will be kinder to the
affected creatures, and will allow them to regenerate mana at an 
accelerated rate for a short period of time.
 
This is a remort spell only.
 
Learned by:
Pearl Dragons~
-1 'HAND TO HAND'~
Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this
style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.
Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.
Most classes can learn this style of fighting, but mages are far to haughty
to consider fighting with their own hands.~
-1 'LIVING STONE'~
Syntax: stone
Gargoyles have the innate power to turn their flesh to stone. This
protects them from damage (because weapons will bounce harmlessly off
their skin) and improve the damage they can do. Note that they also gain
properties of stone... whatever that entails.~
-1 KICK~
Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a 
powerful kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off- 
balance.  Fighters and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although 
thieves may also learn it.~
0 PARRY~
If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is successful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon 
for full success; the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in 
reduced damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs 
when the defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.

Learned by:
All~
-1 TRIP~
Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves
using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the 
ground. Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones 
will find the attack easy to avoid.  Anyone who doesn't excel in the theory
theory of magic is well enough grounded in the physical plane to learn trip.~
0 'SECOND ATTACK'~
Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional 
strikes in combat -- although a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 
attacks every round.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and 
mages have a very hard time with it.

Learned by:
All~
-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~
Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional 
strike in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  

Perfect third attack does NOT ensure three attacks per round.  Only those 
whose main calling is physical combat may learn this skill.~
-1 HIDE SNEAK~
Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.

Hide has a very high chance of success, and is used to remain undetected
while remaining stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), and can keep you from being detected as you leave and
enter a room. These are they kind of things a thief would do, although
rangers have also picked up these tricks.~
-1 'FAST HEALING'~
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, 
resting, or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just 
general toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and 
it is possible for it to fail.  All classes may learn this skill, but 
mages find it very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.~
-1 LORE~
Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
such as its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value
of an object because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may
learn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard
to use.~
-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~
Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best 
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
although all other classes may learn it as well.~
-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. ~
0 STEAL~
Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that 
class. It allows items and gold to be stolen from the inventory of monsters 
and characters!  But beware, attempting to steal from a character earns you 
a THIEF flag if you are caught (making you free game for killing).

Learned by:
Thief~
-1 'RECHARGE'~
Syntax: cast 'recharge' <item>

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell
is proportional to the number of charges used.~
-1 'PORTAL'~
Syntax: cast 'portal' <target>

The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal
to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are
entered using 'enter' command, as in 'enter portal'.  Portals cannot be
made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.
Portal requires a special source of power... Unfortunately, the secret of 
this material component has been lost...~
-1 'NEXUS'~
Syntax: cast 'nexus' <target>

This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the
only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus 
spell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered
portal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret
of which has been lost...~
0 'CRUSHING HAND'~
Syntax: cast 'crushing hand' <target>
 
This spell conjures a massive hand which reaches out to capture your
target. If the target is fast they may be able to evade the hand's
grasping attempts. However, when caught, the victim is slowly squeezed
by the hand, inflicting moderate damage each round until it vanashes.
 
Learned by:
Conjurer~
0 'CLENCHED FIST'~
Syntax: cast 'clenched fist' <target>
 
Clenched fist is a conjuration spell which creates a huge, and powerfull
fist which lashes out at its target. The fist ether strikes at the target
as a balled knuckle sandwich or in a choping motion which the heal of
the hand. This hand does heave damage to anything it hits, and can
knock its target backwards or down with violent force.
 
Learned by:
Conjurer~
-1 'HOLY WORD'~
Syntax: cast 'holy word'

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with
disasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful
blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like deity, clan or
in the same group as the caster are blessed and filled with righteous 
divine wrath, while those of opposite morals are struck down by holy (or 
unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers greatly from the strain of 
this spell, being left drained of energy.  

Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.~
-1 FRENZY~
Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>
The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, 
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's 
alignment.~
-1 CALM~
Syntax: cast 'calm' 

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric 
is the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violent 
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or 
nothing -- either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of 
those who are immune to magic) or none is.
 
Learned by:
Cleric     Druid     Warrior     Paladin~
0 HASTE~
Syntax: cast 'haste' <target>
 
The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing
an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive
abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,
such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating
the slow spell. (see 'help slow').

-1 FEEBLEMIND~
Syntax: cast 'feeblemind' <target>

By means of this spell the caster can temporairly surpress the targets 
mental abbilities. Causing confusion, loss of intelect and loss of wisdom.

target causing some damage.~
-1 PSYCHIC CRUSH~
Syntax: cast 'psychic crush' <target>

This pure blast of raw mental force slams into the targets brain on many
psychic levels. This causes the brain to start hemoraging and causes severe
damage to the nervous system of the target.~
0 SLOW~
Syntax: cast 'slow' <target>
 
Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with its own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows the victim's movements, making them easier to hit and reducing 
their rate of attack.  The effect of slow also doubles movement costs and 
halves healing rates, due to reduced metabolism.

Syntax: cast 'protection evil' 
	cast 'protection good' 
	cast 'protection neutral'

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate

-1 FARSIGHT~
Syntax: cast 'farsight' <victim>

The farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her
to see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense
concentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.

you will receive a general scan of the area around in the mob in all
in directions.

on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good
measure.~
-1 'FLOATING DISC'~
Syntax: cast 'floating disc'

This useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caster
around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight
penalties. It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and
usually less. It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a 
maximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location
on the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it
to run out of energy.~
-1 FIREPROOF~
Syntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>

The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame. Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.

Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.~
-1 SOUNDPROOF~
Syntax: cast 'soundproof' <object>

Soundproof creates a protective aura around an object, making it
impervious to damage from sound waves. Note that it's similar in many
respects to fireproof (see the appropriate help) otherwise.~
-1 LIFEWAVE~
Syntax: cast lifewave

Lifewave is a very powerful healing spell. It creates a ball of
healing energy which expands outwards, travelling from room to
room, healing all clanmates and group members it touches, weakening 
as it travels. But don't be fooled: It travels a fair distance, and
can be extemely useful.

This spell is for reclasses only.

-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~
Syntax: alias
	alias <word>
	alias <word> <substitution>
	unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names. At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one 
command. Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the 
alias with that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and an 
argument produces a new alias. You cannot alias either alias or unalias to 
a new command. Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing 'gc' will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball'--> 'ff orc' will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.~
0 KIRRE FELINE~
Hidden deep in the forests of Dominia, a race of intelligent felines has 
fluorished in total seclusion for centuries. These creatures, who identify
themselves simply as "Kirre", resemble none of the known races of Dominia. 
Their history and origins remain shrouded in mystery and legend. Until now,
the known facts were few: They are a race of six-legged felines, roughly 
6-8 feet in length, and ranging in colour from white to sable. Long tufted 
ears, six legs with razor sharp claws and a prehensile tail give them a 
fearsome appearance. It is reputed that they strike quickly and without mercy.
{x
Over the course of time, the Kirre have become organized into small tribes
consisting of a large number of females, and a few males. It is the strongest 
of these males who typically assumes the leadership role.
{x
Every seven moons the tribal leaders hold a moot in a secret location. 
Recently, discussions have centered around the "Outsiders" -- other Dominian
races which have begun encroaching upon their ancestral hunting grounds. Not
wanting to give up what they perceived as an advantage, the Kirre did not make 
any attempts to persuade these other races that they were anything but bestial 
in nature. It was under this guise that they had ample opportunity to observe 
the behaviour of the intruders and formulate a course of action.
{x
At the most recent of these gatherings, it became strikingly clear the Kirre are 
divided on whether or not they should reveal their true nature. Many believed
that they should continue their ruse, and continue to play the part of the beast,
if only to safeguard their heritage. Others, despite their leaders wishes (and 
to the great consternation of all the tribes involved), have already chosen to 
establish ties with the other Dominian races... And a bold few have even gone so 
far as to call them "friend".
{x
Although there are many warriours among them, Kirre are also adept in the magical 
arts. However, Kirre prefer the more subtle forms of magic, and many show a natural 
aptitude for rune magic. Traditional magic is beyond their ken.
{x
Kirre of all classes prefer using whip-like weapons because of the similarity to
their own tails. Kirre strike quickly, and all practice disarming from a young age.~
0 SABRE KIRRE REMORT~
Remort Kirre have greatly expanded their knowledge of their own natural weapons. 
All have learned how to use their innate abilities with the hand to hand skill. 
Remort Kirre are now able to use their "razor claws" to inflict severe wounds
upon their vidlong, agile tails as weapons to "tail trip" their
opponents. Remort Kirre are nocturnal hunters, and during the day, may be blinded 
by the sun when adventuring.
{x
Only the most elite hunters are known as Sabre Kirre. They bear massive tusks, 
resembling sabre tooth tigers of ancient times. These Kirre have learned how to 
"ambush" their victims, taking deadly advantage of surprise during their initial 
strikes. By moving carefully, sabres are able to use their "concealment" skill to 
 avoid detection.~
0 DARK KIRRE REMORT~
Remort Kirre have greatly expanded their knowledge of their own natural weapons.
All have learned how to use their innate abilities with the hand to hand skill.
Remort Kirre are now able to use their "razor claws" to inflict severe wounds
upon their victims which will continue to bleed for several moments. They have
also learned how to use their long, agile tails as weapons to "tail trip" their
opponents. Remort Kirre are nocturnal hunters, and during the day, may be blinded
by the sun when adventuring.
{x
Dark Kirre have undergone painful rituals which have embued them with preternatural 
powers. They gain the ability to see in the dark using "dark vision". Reciting a 
dirge will shield them with "quill armor" which can hurt attackers. Dark Kirre possess 
the ability to heal themselves by drinking the blood of their victims using their 
"dark feast" skill.~
0 RAZOR CLAWS~
syntax: razor

With a small effort, remort Kirre are able to extend or
retract their razor sharp claws. While extended, the Kirre
cannot use any weapons however their hand to hand strikes
will land terrible wounds which will continue to bleed
for several moments.
 
This skill is for reclasses only.
Learned by:
Dark     Sabre~
0 TAIL TRIP~
syntax: automatic
Natural dexterity and a thick prehensile tail allow remort
Kirre to use their tails during combat. Due to their smaller
size, Kirre tails do not inflict any damage. However, they
are very effective for knocking opponents off balance.~
0 AMBUSH~
syntax: ambush, then attack.

Sabre Kirres have mastered the surprise attack. By setting up
an ambush in a room, they are able to greatly increase the
damage to their victims during the first rounds of combat.
However, if the Kirre leaves the ambush site, they lose the
element of surprise.
 
This skill is for remorts only.
Learned by:
Sabre~
0 CONCEALMENT~
syntax: cast concealment
Sabre Kirres are among the quietest creatures alive during the
hunt. By using concealment, the Sabre is able to get very close
to their victims without being seen. The effort of moving quickly
while staying so silent is very taxing, and can only be done for
brief periods of time.
 
This is a remort spell only.
Learned by:
Sabre~
0 QUILL ARMOR~
syntax: cast 'quill armor'

Dark Kirre can shield themselves by reciting a dirge. Their soft
fur becomes as tough as steel, and laced with pointy quills.
Under the effect of this spell, the Dark Kirre's armor class
improves, and if struck by a physical attack, the attacker may be
stricken by the quills.
 
This skill is for remorts only.
Learned by:
Dark Kirre~
1 DARK FEAST~
Syntax: feast <victim>
 
Dark Kirre practice many disturbing rites, including cannibalism,
ritual sacrifice and blood drinking. Exposure to these dark deeds
has corrupted the Dark Kirre to the point where they are able to 
begin devouring parts of their victims while they are still alive.
By using this power during combat, the Kirre can be healed based on
how close to death their victim is.
 
This is a remort skill only.

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.
The [%] is the chance the reset has of making the reset occur, default is
100%.
{x
For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example if you are equiping a mobile don't load a container in the room
and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the mobile.  It is
likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.
{x

0 RECLASS CLASS REMORT~
syntax: reclass
 
Once you reach level 51 you may reclass your character to gain several
new abilities and also new restrictions.
 
This is the counterpart to remorting. You may remort and reclass in any
order and choose to do one, the other, or both.
 
To reclass will require a specific number of quest points. You can find
out how many by typing reclass once you are level 51.
 
Like remorting, reclassing will send your character back to level one.
It will remove all your equipment and put it in your inventory, and
reset all skills to 1% except for your starting weapon. Your hours 
will be reset, your trains set to 3, and practices to 5. Any skills 
which you gained prior to reclassing will be added to your creation 
points, possibly raising your xp/level. Your stats (strength, etc)
will also be reset to the default for your race. Any trained cp will
not be taken into consideration for your new xp/level.
 
Each character class will be given the choice of two reclasses:
Warrior   -> Barbarian or Warlord
Ranger    -> Hermit or Bounty Hunter
Paladin   -> Cavalier or Templar
Thief     -> Assassin or Rogue
Cleric    -> Exorcist or Heretic
Druid     -> Hierophant or Herbalist
Mage      -> Wizard or Alchemist
Conjurer  -> Shaman or Sorceror
Enchanter -> Mystic or Illusionist
Invoker   -> Necromancer or Diviner
Runist    -> Psion or Zealot
Monk      -> Samurai or Ninja
 
You may find out more by typing help <subclass>.~
0 SECOND REMORT RECLASS SKILLS SPELLS~
All reclass will receive the following skills:
specialization		rub		throw
You may find out specific reclass skills by typing help <subclass>.~
0 WARRIOR BARBARIAN~
Emotions and spirit guide the hand of every warrior. Barbarians are those
who have reached a deeper understanding of the primal self, using the
power of their emotions to unleash never before seen fury. This intense
physical focus has weakened the barbarian's understanding of magic. They
have developed a curious antipathy towards enchanted items which is so
strong they refuse to use any enchanted weapons.

Reclass skills:
Thicken: An increase in physical endurance enables greater capacity.
Martial Arts: Addition hand to hand training, including parry and stun.
Shield Bash: A violent counter attack to stun an opponent.
Enrage: Brutal rage which can protect the mind at the cost of self.
Cave In: Shower a room with rock and debris, damaging and blocking foes.
Rip: The ability to disarm any items held in hand, not just weapons.
Jump: A long distance leap across two rooms.~
0 WARRIOR WARLORD~
The most experienced warriors may seek to dominate others and become
warlords. The warlord rarely fights alone. Ruling with an iron fist,
he leads others into battle more often than not. His training in tactics
and group combat have taken his emphasis away from one on one combat.
A single warlord on his own may find his own combat skills have 
diminished.

Reclass skills:
Thicken: An increase in physical endurance enables greater capacity.
Martial Arts: Addition hand to hand training, including parry and stun.
Dual Wield: Exchanging defense for offense, may use two weapons at once.
Push: The muscle to choose your own battleground.
Rally: Directing your followers directly to coordinate lethal assaults.
Leadership: Using tactics to enhance a group's effectiveness in combat.
Gladiator: Instructing another in the use of weapons.~
0 RANGER HERMIT~
Most rangers walk a fine line between civilization and wilderness. There
are those who choose to completely withdraw from human contact and 
become hermits in order to perfect their skills. Hermits develop a
greater understanding of both nature and the abilities of their own
bodies. Following a strict discipline of solitude and abstinence, all
hermits are forbidden to group with more than one other player at a
time.

Reclass skills:
Thicken: An increase in physical endurance enables greater capacity.
Martial Arts: Addition hand to hand training, including parry and stun.
Shield Bash: A violent counter attack to stun an opponent.
Double Kick: While hasted, sometimes kick twice per round.
Carve Spear: Turn simple tree limbs into deadly weapons.
Iron Vigil: Survive for long periods without food or water.
Plant: Carefully tended gardens can yield surprising results.~
0 RANGER BOUNTY HUNTER~
Among their training, all rangers learn the basics of tracking their
victims. Bounty hunters have turned the skill into a fine art. When
it comes to hunting prey, human or otherwise, it is hard to beat
a bounty hunter. All bounty hunters, as their names implies, are
consummate mercenaries. They are totally motivated by the gold that
awaits them should they slay their victims. A poor bounty will be
poor motivation for the kill, and the bounty hunter's combat skills
will suffer severely. Additionally, bounty hunters may only
claim bounties, never place them.
 
Reclass skills:
Thicken: An increase in physical endurance enables greater capacity.
Iron Vigil: Survive for long periods without food or water.
Hunter ball: A mystical skill to see out of the eyes of your victim.
Dual Wield: Exchanging defense for offense, may use two weapons at once.
Call to Hunt: Summon a hound to track prey quickly.
Slide: The skill of chasing prey if they try to escape via magic gates.
Carve Spear: Turn simple tree limbs into deadly weapons.~
0 PALADIN CAVALIER~
Most paladins come to realize a delicate balance between martial skills
and the powers of their faith. The cavalier is a knight who believes
in using combat skill to defend his beliefs. As a standard for honor,
this knight fearlessly charges into battle alone against fierce odds.
His bravery and skill have somewhat weakened his grip on magic, and
all cavaliers will find the strength of their spells weakened.

Reclass skills:
Thicken: An increase in physical endurance enables greater capacity.
Martial Arts: Addition hand to hand training, including parry and stun.
Shield Bash: A violent counter attack to stun an opponent.
Push: The muscle to choose your own battleground.
Jump: A long distance leap across two rooms.
Fortify: Putting faith to good use.
Charge: Dashing bravely into combat from a room away.~
0 PALADIN TEMPLAR~
Guided by the power of their faith, templars are the domesticated
versions of paladins. Functioning primarily as temple guards, they
grow in faith and magical might under the training of the eldest
clerics. As a show of gratitude, all wandering templars are required
to tithe 10% of all income to the church. In addition, the strong
moral teachings of the templar forbid them from attacking people
far below their level, despite how much the individual may be wanted
by the law.
{x
Reclass:
Thicken: An increase in physical endurance enables greater capacity.
Martial Arts: Addition hand to hand training, including parry and stun.
Missionary: The ability the bend the faith of others.

Silent Prayer: The art of discreetly using recall.
Lesser Dispel: A version of dispel only useful against NPCs.Purify:  Through their faith, a Paladin my clense themselves or others of evil.~
0 THIEF ASSASSIN~
Although the common thief sometimes serves as an assassin, those who
specialize in the art of killing are widely feared for their abilities,
even among other members of the criminal underground. The assassin is
an especially lethal breed of thief who sacrifices some of his
traditional training. Despite specializing in ambushes and surprise 
attacks, the assassin has lost some of his previous talents in sneak,
hide and stealing. His new skills more than make up the loss of
stealth.
{x
Reclass skills:
Deathblow: Marks a victim for assassination.
Jump: A long distance leap across two rooms.
Slide: The skill of chasing prey if they try to escape via magic gates.
Push: The muscle to choose your own battleground.
Spy: Listening in on the other clans to help plan attacks.
Ensnare: Set various traps to incapacitate your victims.
Sap: A sneaky blow to the head to render foes unconscious.~
0 THIEF ROGUE~
The rogue is a master at sleight of hand. Using a combination of magical
and optical illusions, the rogue astounds even the most perceptive
opponent. The rogue's skills lie in stealth and light fingeredness
rather than physical force, so rogues will find they can backstab
much less than before.
{x
Reclass skills:
Tumbling: Advanced acrobatics to avoid various attacks.
Ensnare: Set various traps to incapacitate your victims.
Spy: Information gathering into the affairs of other clans.
Steal Up: Advanced ability to steal directly from containers.

Oculary: A visual illusion which removes you from the sight
of most victims.
Crippling Strike: Ability to reduce their opponent's damage.
Critical Hits: Deals extra damage based on the thief's level.~
0 CLERIC HERETIC~
Not all clerics fall within the established hierarchy of faiths.
The few who choose to break tradition are branded as heretics by all
whom they meet. Weaving human sacrifices and other dark arts into the
expression of their faith, heretics reach out to the darker powers. No
heretic may follow the tenets of good, and must remain evil to invoke 
any of their dark powers.

Reclass skills:
Drain Life: Vile magic which taints the very soul.
Create Oil: The creation of explosive missile weapons.
Moonbeam: Channeling the powers of darkness into the undead.
Atheism: Undermining the faith of others.
Animate Dead: Raising the dead to do your bidding.
Cryogenesis: Preserving gruesome trophies.
Withstand Death: The dark arts of cheating death.
Nightmares: Inciting a powerful curse onto others.~
0 CLERIC EXORCIST~
Ever since the arts of magic revealed our world to creatures from
beyond, the planet has been plagued by many sorts of demons and
alien intelligences. The undead are among those whose misshapen
form goes against the very nature of our world. The exorcists are
powerful forces of good who fight to maintain the natural order.
They are dedicated to helping the common man recognize and fight
off these evils. They must remain seperate from that which they
battle, and remain good aligned in order to use any of their
powers.

Reclass skills:
Magic Stone: Using the might of mother earth to smite your foes.
Create Oil: The creation of explosive missile weapons.
Life Wave: A superior healing power which can restore the 
surrounding area.
Summon Angel: Calls upon one holy angel to fight by your side.
Turn Undead: A potent invocation which can completely eradicate undead.
Missionary: Your fervent beliefs can make others doubt their own.
Silent Prayer: The skill of discreetly praying to recall.~
0 DRUID HIEROPHANT~
The eldest of the druids may attain the rank of hierophant. It is
said one cannot attain the status of hierophant in a single life-
time, and that those that do are the reincarnated spirits of animals
and trees. They may call upon the true spirits of mother nature
to create many unusual effects. As a follower of nature, all
hierophants must not stray from the path of neutrality. If they
break this restriction, nature will strip them of their hierophant
powers.

Reclass skills:
Winter Storm: Calling down a seasonal change to blanket an area.
Animate Tree: Summoning the eternal strength of the trees to aid you.
Whirlpool: Turn placid waters into a powerful vortex.
Earth to Mud: Liquify ground so it absorbs items and slows fleeing.
Sunray: A dazzling ray that will blind everyone in the room.
Wildfire: Potent magic to break the enchantment of equipment.
Nature Protection: Guards against one random element.~
0 DRUID HERBALIST~
Within nature there are an equal number of plants both beautiful
and lethal. The herbalist is a druid who has learned to control
these plants and live with them in perfect synthesis. He may call
upon their aid in many ways, and for him, only him, they listen
and obey willingly. As such, the herbalist will find his powers
weakened within the city or indoor areas. His focus is the great
outdoors.

Reclass skills:
Winter Storm: Calling down a seasonal change to blanket an area.
Animate Tree: Summoning the eternal strength of the trees to aid you.
Iron Vigil: Survive for long periods without food or water.
Plant: Carefully tended gardens can yield surprising results.
Nature Protection: Guards against one random element.
Shock Wave: A focused vacuum that can blast people out of the room.
Tornado: Channeling the winds into a powerful vortex.~
0 MAGE WIZARD~
Experienced mages must pass many trials before they can be
recognized as true wizards. The wizard adds several new powers
to this arsenal, including an enhanced understanding of imbuing
many items with magic, and the ability to bend the recall prayer
to their own needs. Wizards tend to be an arrogant lot, who use
their magic quite flamboyantly. They possess the knowledge of
so many spells that they insist on never needing to use the
same spell three times in a row.

Reclass skills:
Prismatic Sphere: A potent multi layered defensive spell.
Channel Energy: The ability to channel raw magical energy at a target.
Sharpen: A quick enchantment to make weapons more deadly.
Wizards Eye: The power to glimpse into far away areas.
Beacon: Powerful enchantment to redirect the recall prayer.
Scribe: Copying down a magic spell onto scroll for later use.
Attraction: Insidious telekinetic magic to strip a victim.~
0 MAGE ALCHEMIST~
In their journeys mages learn to deal with many unusual
substances. By studying the lost science of alchemy, the alchemist
can learn important skills in the creation and use of potions
and other liquids. Alchemists specialize mostly in the use
of non combat magics, preferring quiet study and experimentation
to direct conflict. As non-combat mages well trained in the use of 
potions and other magic items, alchemists will find it more difficult 
to use their spells in the high stress situations created by combat, 
making any spells use during a fight cost a small amount of extra mana.

Reclass skills:
Prismatic Sphere: A potent multi layered defensive spell.
Create Oil: The creation of explosive missile weapons.
Cryogenesis: Preserving gruesome trophies.
Embellish: Subtly increasing the enchantment on any magic item.
Replication: A one time copy of a potion can be made scientifically.
Combine Potion: Different brews may be fixed into one effective one.
Flesh Golem: Gruesome creature made from collected remains.~
0 CONJURER SHAMAN~
The shaman is a conjurer who focuses on the magic of the spirit.  By
tapping into the realm of souls, the shaman is able to unleash many new
hexes which specifically attack the very soul of their victims.  This
warping and reshaping of linking magics reduces all of the shaman's
abilities to use spells for transportation.  
 
Reclass skills:
Combine Potion: Different brews may be fixed into one effective one.
Symbol: A sigil of warding which can protect your equipment.
Cryogenesis: Preserving gruesome trophies.
Repel: The ability to lock-down certain rooms against intrusion.
Jinx: A quick hex which can reduce the soul's resistance.
Flesh Golem: Gruesome creature made from collected remains.
Voodoo Doll: Creation of totems to torture victims from afar.~
0 CONJURER SORCEROR~
The sorceror is an imposing figure. He literally crackles with the
raw magical energy that infuses his own being. The sorceror excels
in several unique and powerful spells which are able to both 
completely create and destroy victims with only a few words. The
sorceror commands fantastic powers, and he must be careful lest
they overwhelm him. Sorcerers who try to regain mana when they are
already at full will be horribly burned by the excess energy.

Reclass skills:
Combine Potion: Different brews may be fixed into one effective one.
Symbol: A sigil of warding which can protect your equipment.
Shock Wave: A focused vacuum that can blast people out of the room.
Scribe: Copying down a magic spell onto scroll for later use.
Sunray: A dazzling ray that will blind everyone in the room.
Duplicate: A copy of the caster which can fool attackers.
Soul Trap: Trapping mobiles into figurines which can be used later.~
0 ENCHANTER MYSTIC~
The mystic focuses his attentions inward. Through the powers of
meditation the mystic learns to focus his magic in new directions.
All mystics gradually develop powerful psionic powers. The most
potent of these include the amazing telepathic power to steal spells
from the memory of victims, and also includes some telekinetic powers.
Mystics must meditate for several hours daily in order to maintain
the high mental fitness needed for their profession. A mystic who
does not keep up this restriction will find all his magical powers
gradually degrade.

Reclass skills:
Remove Align: Removes the alignment restrictions on equipment.
Flag: Enchant a weapon with a single weapon flag temporarily.
Abandon: Lock down rooms against transportation magic of all types.
Attraction: Insidious telekinetic magic to strip a victim.
Repel: The ability to lock-down certain rooms against intrusion.
Spell Stealing: Use the magical skills of another.
Jinx: A quick hex which can reduce the soul's resistance.~
0 ENCHANTER ILLUSIONIST~
Although many magic users are trained in the use of simple
illusionary magic, the illusionist specializes in it to the exclusion
of all others. Many illusionists can seem slightly unhinged. Because
of the things they have seen, some begin to lose the distinction
between what is real and what is not. Due to the nature of their
specialization, illusionists begin to lose power on all of their
former enchantment spells to compensate for their new gifts.

Reclass skills:
Remove Align: Removes the alignment restrictions on equipment.
Flag: Enchant a weapon with a single weapon flag temporarily.
Jinx: A quick hex which can reduce the soul's resistance.
Duplicate: A copy of the caster which can fool attackers.
Shadow Magic: A second, weaker copy of the spell will be cast for free.
Create Door: Able to form a maze of closable doors to fool victims.
Oculary: A visual illusion which removes you from the sight
of most victims.~
0 INVOKER NECROMANCER~
Many invokers deal with forces that would terrify other mortals on
a daily basis. None is more terrifying than those rare invokers
who choose to deal with the forces of entropy and death. The
necromancer learns magic which deals exclusively with the dead
and other denizens of the negative material plane. As part of this
contact, the path of good is forever closed to the true necromancer.
Any who stray from this path will be unable to use their necromantic
powers.

Reclass skills:
Meteor Swarm: A spell of massive destructive force and range.
Drain Life: Vile magic which taints the very soul.
Skeletal Warrior: Summons an aid from the negative material plane.
Animate Dead: Raising the dead to do your bidding.
Cryogenesis: Preserving gruesome trophies.
Withstand Death: The dark arts of cheating death.
Oculary: A visual illusion which removes you from the sight
of most victims.~
0 INVOKER DIVINER~
Knowledge is power. All magic users accept this as simple truth.
The diviner might seem an odd line of training for the usually
flamboyant invoker, however many diviners would argue that their
knowledge and understanding makes them even more dangerous than
previously. Regardless, diviners will find their offensive magics
somewhat weakened by the transformation.

Reclass skills:
Meteor Swarm: A spell of massive destructive force and range.
Delayed Blast Fireball: An explosive magic that builds with time.
Inform: A quick glimpse into the powers of another.
Spy: Information gathering into the affairs of other clans.
True Sight: Powerful spell to see through any stealth.
Wizards Eye: The power to glimpse into far away areas.
Oculary: A visual illusion which removes you from the sight
of most victims.~
0 RUB DIRT~
syntax: rub

This skill allows a character the chance to remove the blindness
imposed by dirt kick or flaming weapons. Other forms of magical
blindness cannot be cured in this way. This skill may not be used
in combat.

This skill is for reclasses only.
Learned by:
All~
0 SPECIALIZE SPECIALZIATION~
syntax: specialize <skill>

Any reclass may use this command to specify a single skill in 
which to specialize. The specialized skill may then attain
a rating of 130%. The additional 30% must be learned in the
normal method, and is not automatically granted. A reclass
may change specializations as often as desired, however,
changing your specializion will severely reduce the previous
skill.

At this time, only a few skills may be specialized. With time
others may become available.

The possible specializations are:
Dagger		Sword		Spear		Mace
Axe		Polearm		Whip		Flail
Hand to Hand	Parry		Dodge		Shield Block

This command is for reclasses only.

0 PRISMATIC SPHERE~
This powerful defensive magic surrounds the caster with a
multi-layered sphere composed of seven different colours.
Anyone foolish enough to attack the caster will then be
blasted by one or more of the colour layers. If the caster
takes any offensive actions, the spell will be broken 
immediately.

This spell is for reclasses only.

Learned by:
Wizard		Alchemist~
0 CREATE OIL GREEK FIRE~
This incantation will produce a small leather flask filled
with a flammable liquid and enchanted with a potent attack
spell. These flasks of greek fire may be saved as long as
necessary, and can be hurled at foes as thrown weapons.
 
This spell is for reclasses only.

Learned by:
Alchemist       Heretic         Exorcist~
0 SHARPEN~
This enchantment allows the caster to enchant any weapon with
powerful killing dweomers. The weapon will be significantly
increased in both hit and damage, but unlike a real enchant,
this spell will fade with time.

This spell is for reclasses only.

Learned by:
Wizard~
0 FLOATING WIZARDS EYE~
This scrying magic will place a hidden, invisible magic eye
in any room. The eye will stay where it is while the caster
goes about his business. At any time, the cast may type
'look eye' to glimpse into the floating eye and see who is
in the surrounding area.
 
This spell is for reclasses only.
 
Learned by:
Wizard          Diviner~
0 BEACON RECALL~
In order to plan a convenient escape, this spell was created to
alter the normal recall prayer. After casting this spell on a
room, the caster's next successful recall attempt will send him
to this beacon instead of the normal recall location. The magic
will only function once, and cannot be focused if you are in the
middle of a fight.
 
This spell is for reclasses only.
 
Learned by:

0 DUAL WIELD~
The epitome of weapon skills allows a character to

of wielding a second weapon. It takes great skill
and dexterity to be able to fight with two weapons
without getting tangled up. While using two weapons

alternate between weapons on each attack. This
technique offers several obvious advantages,
including greater ease of parrying, and the fact
that being disarmed will only remove a single
weapon. There are restrictions on each weapon
however. Neither weapon can be large enough to 
have ever required two hands, and certain classes

skill, lowering the warrior's mind to that of a savage

can filch items from any containers the victim
has.

syntax: swap <left/right> <victim> <left/right>

Cunning rogues can quickly swap their own rings for
one that the victim is wearing. They will lose the
ring they are wearing by doing this.~
1 CRIPPLING STRIKE~
Rogues are very nimble thieves and consequentially have become very
precise when handling their weapons.  While not as strong as their
counterparts, their added nimbleness can cause their backstabs to give a
"crippling strike" on their victims.  With this strike they can make their
victims more vulnerable to damage. This skill is automatic during backstabs.

0 HUNTER BALL~
This odd ability allows the bounty hunter to get
a fixation on his target. He can see out of their
eyes using magically created and imbued orbs.
To use this skill requires three steps.

First, blank orbs may be created by typing:
"hunter create"

Then an orb may be imbued with an aura by typing:
"zap <victim>" using your wands skill.

Lastly you may view through your victim's eyes once
and only once for each orb by typing:
"hunter" while holding the orb.

This skill is for reclasses only.

                    keyword hedit 'help edit' 'help files'
                    This command capitalizes the keywords automatically.
    
text              - Enters the string editor to modify to help file text body.
                    This editor uses the same commands as OLC (.c .r and @)
    
commands          - Shows all hedit commands.
   
show              - Shows the current help you are editing. Done if you press
                    enter.
   
done              - Stops editing help files and returns to normal command
                    interpreter.
   
The following of the above commands can be executed even if you are not

52 'RANK SET' 'RANK STRIP'~
Syntax: rank set <player> <rank>
Syntax: rank strip <player>
 
This set of commands allows a clan leader to set and remove a member of
their clan's rank. This command should not be abused to create outlandish
or inappropriate ranks for people, and may be regulated by Immortals if this
is the case.
 
RANK SET will set a member's rank, and RANK STRIP will remove it.~
0 NAMES~
Redemption does not enforce role-playing, however, we have adopted
a naming convention which restricts new characters to names which are
acceptable in the context of medieval fantasy. If your name does not
fit this theme, you may be renamed or deleted at any time with or
without warning by the immortals.
 
The following guidelines apply to naming:
-Numerical references are not permitted. 
-Names of a sexual or profane nature are not permitted.
-Nonsensical names are not permitted.
-Names from literature or history may not be appropriate.
-Names which are too similar to existing characters may not be appropriate.
-Use of real-life names of people, places or objects may not be appropriate.
-Compound names may not be appropriate.
 
Common sense generally applies. If you are asked to rename, you must comply.
Most renaming will be done before level 10, but there may be exceptions.

0 WEAPON FLAG~
Many enchantments exist to make weapons more deadly using magical
means to supplement the simple cuts and thrusts they can inflict.
The following is a list of conventional weapon flags, most of
which are accessible via mutate or can be found in the game.
 
-SHARP weapons have a chance to deal extra physical damage each hit.
-FLAMING weapons burn targets briefly, and have a chance to blind
their victims with smoke, and ignite certains types of flamable items.
-SHOCKING weapons zap targets with electricity, and have a chance to
stun the victim by disrupting their nervous system. Shocking weapons
can also fuse together some items such as jewelry or wands.
-FROST weapons chill their victims. The cold can shatter potions,
and a lucky hit can numb a victim, consuming their movement and lowering
their strength temporarily.
can also fuse together some items such as jewelry or wands.
-FLOODING weapons drown their victims. The water can flood potions, and a
lucky hit can drop the victim's dexterity and even strip their haste.
-CORROSIVE weapons splash acid with each hit, they can dissolve fragile
items such as clothing, and have a chance of weakening the overall
defenses of someone by exposing vital organs.
-VAMPIRIC weapons thirstily drain additional life from their victims
with each hit, and restore some of it to their wielder, healing them
slightly.
-SOUL DRAIN weapons also suck life from their victims, but they
convert it to magical energy restoring the mana of their wielders
instead. The rate of return is slower than that of vampiric.
-POISON weapons have a chance to poison victims but do not do extra
damage with hit. Once poisoned, the victim loses a bit of health
and strength and will continue to weakened by the poison each tick.
-INFECTED weapons have a chance of bring the plague to their victims,
causing them to lose strength and health. Each tick it will also
drain their health, mana and movement. The plague is highly contagious.
-TWO HANDED: Most characters need to remove their shield to use these
weapons, and larger characters will need to use both hands to receive any
benefits. When wielded in two hands, a weapon does extra damage with
each hit and is much harder to have disarmed.
-VORPAL weapons are extremely sharp and with a lucky strike you can
kill almost any mob, reducing it to zero hit points regardless of how
tough it is. This flag also grants the chance of scoring critical hits
that do extra damage.
-DRAGON SLAYER weapons are specially imbued for the single purpose
of defeating dragonkind. These weapons inflict brutal wounds to any
wyrm they strike, but have no benefit against any other targets.
-DULL: The edges of these weapons are dulled so that they inflict
less damage against normal targets. Some targets may be more vulnerable
to the trauma damage caused by these weapons, however...
-BLUNT: These weapons are not fully tempered for battle and always
inflict pathetically low damage against any target.
 
More recently, some additional flags have been discovered, however
the following flags appear ONLY on rare crafted items due to their
lethalness.
 
-HOLY weapons inflict additional damage against evil foes, on top
of any other benefits the weapon has.
-UNHOLY weapons inflict additional damage against good foes, on top
of any other benefits the weapon has.
-POLAR weapons inflict additional damage against neutral foes, on top
of any other benefits the weapon has.
-PHASING weapons are partially insubstantial. They have a chance of
phasing through any attempts at parrying or blocking them with each
attack.
-DEMONIC weapons mimic the spell demonfire, and with each chance have
a chance of releasing the demon trapped within them, who will lash out
and curse their victims for a short stint.
-PSIONIC weapons have a chance of unleashing a powerful mental
blast against victims, dulling their wits and making them more susceptible
to magical attacks.
-ENTROPIC weapons are vile things which feed upon the life force of
their wielders. Each time they strike a victim, their wielder is leeched
of life.
-ANTIMAGIC weapons hungrily devour their wielders own mana reserves
during battle to power themselves. If the wielder has no more mana left,
the weapon will try to claim their very soul.~
1 DESTROY RUNE~
Syntax: cast 'destroy rune'
        cast 'destroy rune' <object>
 
Powerful Runists can not only create runes, but can also destroy them.
With the destroy rune spell, a Runist is capable of banishing runes in
a room, as well as on objects.  Be careful, however, destroying runes
can be just as dangerous as becoming a victim to one.
 
Learned By:
Runists~
1 IGNORE WOUNDS~
Syntax: cast 'ignore wounds'
  
A high level zealot becomes an expert at channelling pain, and can
quite literally ignore any wounds dealt to them by secondary attackers
while they focus single-mindedly on slaying their main target. This
spell allows Zealots to survive in combat against overwhelming
numbers.

Zealot~
59 MEMBERLIST MEMBER LIST~
Syntax: memberlist <clan> <recipient>
 
By using the memberlist command, you can quickly access a clan's member listing and
have it sent to someone via a personal note. This command uses system calls, so don't
go spamming it profusely.~
1 HELLIONS CLUB~
excerpt taken from Stoneridges Mayor...
 
Day of the Sun, 13th the Month of Futility.
 
The town is in good spirits and the citizens are
prospering under the renewed trade negotiatons with
the nearby towns. It seems that all have recognized
that we can all share the land of terra and all
prosper at the same time. Crime rate has dropped to an
all time low as the town guardsmen are happy with
their new uniforms and weapons. It seems that things
are looking peaceful in the coming months. 
* one of the guildhouses; The 'Shaking Tree' have
handed over the keys to their house to me. It seems
Elder Willow has some important business to attend to
in the north. Apparently his whole guild travels with
him to the lost town of Istanbul. Elder Willow has
asked that i have some servants maintain the house and
keep in good repair so that when he returns on the new
moon it'll be like he never left. My luck goes out to
him finding that town.
 
Day of the Star 26th the Month of Futilty
 
Its rains today but spirits soar within the city. The
rain provides plenty of nourishment for our crops and
it looks to be a bountiful harvest this season. A
strange occurence has happened today. A gentleman with
two associated - whom he failed to introduce to me has
taken the keys to the Guildhouse of 'The Shaking
Tree'. He's provided me with no name, only the deeds
to the house a large sum of gold, and a letter from
Elder Willow. It seems Elder Willow has made a niche
in Istanbul and plans on remaining there. His
signature and seal seems to be in good order. I
offered my hand in friendship to the newcomers and
asked their names. The lead one just raised his
eyebrow at me. He said 'We're simply the Hellions' and
left. 
 I have placed the gold in the city's coffers.
 
 
Day of the Moon, 8 Month of the Dragon
 
The guildhouses are in utter chaos. Ever since the
Hellions moved in there have been nothing but trouble.
The other guilds claim that the Hellions are
snobberish, elitist and downright nasty. Strangers
visit in the middle of the night, smelly dwarves in
the middle of the day and petty thieves in the
morning. I've gone out and tried to settle things with
the Hellions - but their guildmaster - Tantrum as he
calls himself...(what kind of name is that?) just
smiles at me and brushes me aside. Pretty soon I'll
have to evict them out with the towns soldiers.
 
 
Day of the Star, 17 Month of the Dragon
 
It seems the towns guardsmen ..how shall I put it..
are happy with the Hellions. They've been given new
uniforms and it seems although i have yet to prove
this... some of them are getting a second wage. They
still do what I ask them but I have noticed a distint
undercurrent of distain from them. It looks like I may
need new guards. The other guilds seem to have settled
down. 
 
 
Day of the Sun, 21 Month of the Dragon
 
My city guards are openly disobeying my every
command. In fact, I cant even find any of my city
workers. The Guilds are in a row again and I am
powerless to change anything. I have been openly
accused of skimming from the city's coffers and have
recently just had my life threatened by more than a
few of the city's officials! I shall try and settle
things once in for all. I curse the day The Hellions
arrived. I suspect that they are to blame for this
catastrophe of events that have taken place.
 
 
Day of the Tree 25 Month of the Dragon
 
I leave today for Istanbul. An offer by Elder Willow
with a position that pays considerably well more than
this miserable city offers me has made me decide to
leave. I have my map and my belongings and I wish the
next mayor of this horrible city the best of luck. May
the Hellion Club burn, and may it be a long lasting
fire. I hate them and I quit.
 
Hellions Club is ruled by the Black King or the White
King. Its old money, and its members are noted by
their titles (the colour of black or white, and the
soldiers of the chess board). No offers to join, only
recruited. ~
1 TRAVELLER'S TRAVELLERS REST~
After traversing the great continent of Terra, Fey and Jahid, walking 
hand in hand met upon a great crossroad in the town of Stoneridge. It 
seemed recently scuffed with the passing of many feet this way and 
that. And with the spinning of a masterful idea Fey mentioned to her 
husband that her feet were too sore to go on much farther. So with 
care for his wife he broke camp and together they surveyed the flat 
land around them. Over dinner they talked of the tavern they would 
build; a place of pure balance. A place of entertainment and gossip, 
forgotten lore and hidden secrets. Where the drink will flow like 
rivers and great plans of adventure will hatch over fine foods. And 
these two, Fey and Jahid, puttering about the grand room serving 
drinks, are lending the advice of experienced Traveller's. For here 
lies the way between nowhere and somewhere. There is no history but 
that which you make come to bear. So bring some knowledge, bring some 
cheer, have a seat and grab a beer. Share some tales to see whose 
best, take a break at {bTraveller's {yRest{x. 
{x
Ranks:
Every member in {bTraveller's {yRest{x is expected to lend a helping 
hand when they can and share the knowledge they have acquired 
in their travels free of charge especially to other guild members 
regardless of their rank.
{x
Wanderer
This is the rank you get when you enter. It basically means you aren't 
a regular "customer" of the bar and take no part in running it. Wanderers 
like any other rank are expected to periodically donate. If no donation is 
seen in a long period of time with no good reason wanderers will be 
removed from establishment. Remember the guild will grow according to 
the amount of donations received so no donations means no 
growth.
{x
Traveller
A traveller is a regular "customers" of the bar who is expected 
to be active and to donate more frequently then the regular wanderers. 
With this rank comes the respect or your superiors and somewhat of 
a say in what upgrades take place. To become a traveller 15,000 gold 
followed by regular donation must be received, while keeping in mind 
that these donations do not have to be huge. If a traveller goes inactive 
or stops donating for a long period of time with no good reason they 
will be demoted to wanderer.
{x
Waiter and waitresses
These are loyal "customers" who have earned themselves a position in 
the bar staff. They of course are the members that are most active and who 
donate the most. With this rank comes more respect from your superiors 
and of course more of a say in what upgrades take place. If a new recruiter 
is needed for any reason they will be chosen from members that fall in this 
rank. To become a waiter or a waitress 50,000 gold followed by regular 
donation must be received, while keeping in mind that these donations do 
not have to be huge. If a waiter/waitress goes inactive or stops donating for 
a long period of time they will be demoted to Traveller.
{x
One need only to follow this convention to become a member of the 
Establishment:
{x
1. The regular requirement for entrance into a guild (5000 gold) plus 
a tribute to the maintenance of the establishment. 
2. Those that enter will be expected to help maintain the establishment 
on a reasonable basis.
3. You aren't forced to share your knowledge but it is encouraged. It is
against the rules to charge guild members for verbal help and teachings.~
1 PARADOX KINDRED 'CLAN SPELL' PRAY~
Calling upon their belief in the force of Chaos, members of Kindred are able
to create a paradox by existing in two places at once. In fact, the paradox 
spirit is a copy of the summoner from an alternate reality. Paradox spirits 
look and behave like their creators, even bearing the same weapons and spells. 
They will relentlessly hunt down a chosen victim. Paradox spirits are not part 
of this plane, and reality will dispose of them in short order, leaving not a 
trace of their existence.
 
Syntax: pray paradox <target>
 
This spell summons a mob which is a duplicate of the creator and hunts down 
and attacks a target. They can only be summoned every few minutes, and decay 
quickly.

1 JUSTICE HISTORY~
With order comes peace, and with peace, prosperity. For ages long past, the
ancient clan of Justice has defended and upheld the laws of the land.
Killers and thieves alike have bowed to the might of the Just. Without our
might comes anarchy. United, we can defeat any foe. Divided, we are nothing.
{x
Historically, the ranks of Justice have been many and varied. Throughout the
world's history there have always been the clan's presence on Terra, though
at times the strength of order has faltered and anarchy has reigned. With
strong leaders and loyal followers, Justice can prevail.
{x
The credo of Clan Justice is as follows:
"Never harm a woman or a child. Do not lie, cheat or steal.
These things are for lesser men.
Protect the weak against the evil strong.
Never allow thoughts of gain to lead you into the pursuit of evil.
Never back away from an enemy. Either fight or surrender.
It is not enough to say 'I will not be evil.'
Evil must be fought wherever it is found."
{x
{x
General Rules
- Carnas is a false deity and worshipping him breeds only chaos. Anyone
caught worshipping Carnas will be lonered.
{x
- No charmies are allowed when player killing. The only exception is against
players who break their own clan rules by using more than 2, or when
breaking or defending a clan hall.
{x
- No looting of a player kill, regardless of clan, unless they have been
blacklisted. The only lootable items are potions, bank notes, vouchers,
gold, wands, and scrolls.
{x
- Disarmed/gravved/stolen/ripped/detonated/heated items must be returned
promptly at no cost to the victim after any fighting. No exceptions unless
the victim is blacklisted.
{x
- No spam killing anyone unless they are blacklisted. This rule is waived if
the victim attacks or steals from a Seeker or a Justice. Otherwise, any
slain enemies have 2 hours safe time.
{x
- Treat every clan and every player with respect. No name-calling, no
badmouthing, no cursing over public channels. If they just died, treat them
with dignity and return their equipment promptly. If you died, remain silent
for a moment and consider what you could have done to get out of the
situation before asking for your equipment.
{x
{x
With Other Clans
- Kenshi: Kenshi are fair game on both continents, but co-operation with
them is at your discretion. They are generally honorable and fair, and can
be trusted.
{x
- Venari: Venari, in the same manner as Kenshi, fight their battles with
fairness and respect in mind. Treat them the same way as you treat Kenshi.
{x
- Kindred: They are generally untrustworthy and sow chaos wherever they
appear. They have always been the cause of disharmony on Terra, and should
be treated as enemies. However, in certain circumstances, allying with them
is a necessary evil; ask permission from a higher Justice rank before you do
so.
{x
- Seeker: Not only are the nonviolent Seekers not game to kill, all Justice
are highly encouraged to protect and defend them whenever possible. All
Seekers should be able to ask an online Justice for aid and expect help in
some form, if in trouble. Any blacklisted seekers are exempt from this rule.
{x
- Loners: Loners are untrustworthy, except for characters of level 10-15.
Any loners who have been known to kill other players should be treated as
the enemy. In addition, if the loner has been known to loot, they are
automatically blacklisted and can be looted and repeatedly killed (up to 3x
per hour). Any loner of 10-15 who has not been known to kill or steal should
be treated as a Seeker of that level.
{x
{x
Other Rules
Entry into Justice: Any player from any clan can be approved to enter the
ranks of Justice, at the discretion of the Leader or Recruiters. Anyone with
the potential to mutiny (r/r 51s) -must- be approved by the Leader
beforehand. Anyone who has been previously blacklisted can NOT enter the
ranks of Justice without the Leader's approval.
{x
Ranks:
-Militia: The Militia are the rank-and-file of the Justice clan. All
newcomers begin with this rank. They begin by learning the rules and
requirements of a proper Justice clanmember, helping his or her clanmates,
and donating to the clan gold funds. When in this rank you should be doing
your utmost to learn how everything works, and get to know the continent you
are most often on.
{x
-Defender: The Defender is a firm believer in defense being the best
offense. They are able to immediately come to the rescue of anyone in need
and have the skill and experience to get in and out safely. Any Militia or
higher who is a paladin, cleric, druid, warrior, or ranger may acquire this
rank with a 10,000 gold donation and a level of at least 40.
{x
-Hunter: The Hunter is an expert in chasing down his or her prey. Above all
they know their way around the continent, particularly to 
the common
gatepost mobs and leveling areas, and have the skill and experience to track
down any target. Where the Defender is focused solely on defense, the Hunter
is focused mainly on offense. Any Militia or higher who has either the Hunt
skill or the Gate spell may donate 15,000 gold to gain this rank.
{x
-Merchant: Justice is not solely about fighting. The Merchant helps the clan
in other ways -- by donating gold, creating potions or throwing items, or
fetching items for clanmates. They form a quite important part of the clan
itself and are ranked above Defenders and Hunters. Any Militia with Summon
or any item-creation skill (brew, carve spear, etc) may donate 25,000 gold
to become a Merchant.
{x
-Champion: The elite in the ranks of the Just. Champions are those who show
exceptional skill, leadership abilities, and have been in the clan for a
good amount of time. They are ranked above the previous four and should be
respected accordingly. Any Defender, Hunter, or Merchant may become a
Champion by donating 30,000 gold, and must have at least 40 player kills.
{x
-Grey Council: The Council is the ruling body of Justice. Unlike other
clans, Justice is a democracy, and important decisions are made by a vote.
There can never be more than 6 non-leadership Council members at any time;
if every spot is full, the player who logs on least often among the Council
will lose their spot. Decisions made by the Council include:
-- Beginning and ending of loot wars
-- Adding or removing blacklists (though leadership can automatically add
them)
-- Offline lonering of any player
-- Clan hall upgrades and changes
-- Alliances and wars with other clans
In addition, any Council member also has access to the clan's funds, and can
use some of it for personal reasons (buying of eq, etc) by asking the
Leader. Any Council member may force a vote on any topic they feel is
necessary; a deadlock is broken by the Leader, who has 2 votes in such a
case rather than the other Council and Recruiter's 1 each. Voting is done 2
days after it's been called, whether or not everyone has voted on it. So log
often! Council members should be respected above all other ranks except
actual leadership.
- To become a Council member, one must be of Champion rank, donate 35,000
gold (above what's already donated), and have at least 60 player kills. In
addition, they must be voted in by a majority of the other Council members.~
1 SEEKER RANKS~
Seekers ranks:
{x
{BApprentice{x:
{x
Upon entering the clan, a Seeker becomes an Apprentice to a Master who 
will be responsible for teaching them tips for survival, as well as 
sharing personal experiences that could otherwise teach lessons. A Master
is an Apprentice's personal guide to seeking redemption, who should be 
valued and respected. When the Master feels that their Apprentice is 
ready, and if the Apprentice agrees, s/he will have the opportunity to 
advance to the rank of Journeyperson by the means of completing a quest.
An Apprentice must be willing to learn, as this is the period where you
will learn much wisdom from your Master. This is also the time where you
can decide and best judge whether Seeker is the best clan for you. As an
Apprentice, your priorities should be focused towards leveling, learning
about the life of a Seeker and adapting to it, and learning from your
Master to prepare yourself for advancement to the rank of Journeyperson.
{x
{GJourneyperson{x:
{x
Apprentices that have been promoted to Journeyperson play a more 
involved role in the clan. Bearing the wisdom their Master has taught
them as an Apprentice in mind, a Journeyperson may enroll into one of
the three Houses to professionalize their study in that particular
field under the instruction of the House Master. Once a Journeyperson
feels they're ready, they may apply to the Grand Master to be promoted
to Master rank by means of a challenging quest.
{x
A Journeyperson's time should be focused on leveling, contributing and
learning about/to the functions of their House, and helping out
Apprentices and fellow Journeypeople. Journeypeople should be perfectly
in tune with the clan's rules, policies, and ideals; as well as be
contributing towards the clan's general development.
{x
{yMaster{x:
{x
The highest rank of Seeker; Masters are directly responsible for their
Apprentices and Journeypeople, and helping them seek Redemption by 
sharing their wisdom and lessons with them. Masters are involved with
the development of the clan as a whole, and are charged with clan 
defense. Masters will set a policy on any questions not already covered
in the rules or outlined by the Grand Master. Their word is law.
Masters must also contribute ideas and vote on issues raised on the 
Councils. Some Masters may be advanced to the rank of House Master, in
which case they will be responsible for the development and
functionality of the House, as well as teaching the Journeypeople who
are members of the House.
There will be a limit of Master positions based on the size of the 
clan. Each House will have a minimum of a House Master.  The number
of Masters will be evenly distributed amongst the three houses.  Above
and beyond this will be the Leader, also referred to as the Grand 
Master.  Mastership is not only earned but it is given as well.  
Beyond questing in order to prove oneself as having the qualities of
a Master, the position must be passed on by a current Master who is
ready to move on to other aspects of the clan or granted by the Grand 
Master.
{x
{x
{rQuests & Ranks{x
{x
There are 3 basic ranks Apprentice, Journeyperson and Master.  Each
member when they join Seeker will receive the rank of Apprentice.  
People who have obtained the rank of Journeyperson have shown more than
a basic understanding of the world of Redemption, shown potential, and
shown dedication to clan Seeker and the propelling of its beliefs.  
Beyond that is the rank of Master achieved only by those who have 
committed themselves to clan Seeker and the benefit of its membership.
Moving up in ranks in Seeker is a lifestyle choice.  You must believe
in what Seeker does, you must show through example your dedication to
those beliefs.  You must truly wish to seek your own Redemption.
{x
In order to advance in rank, an Apprentice or Journeyperson must 
successfully complete a quest. A quest is a personal challenge issued
by a Master to one or a small group of his/her Apprentices or 
Journeypeople. If you're stuck,you can always ask a Master for a hint 
or a bit of advice to get you on the right track.
{x
After a quest is assigned, it is to be kept personal and private, and 
is not to be discussed with anyone lower than Master rank. Quests have
five main components: Knowledge, Aid, Wealth, Wisdom, and Strength.
{x
{BKnowledge{x:  The knowledge component of the quest is typically 
determined by the Grand Master and the Master of the person seeking 
advancement.  This quest is a show of knowledge of the world of 
redemption.  This can be a quest to retrieve an item, it can be an 
expression of multiple class and race knowledge, or it can be
something else that shows personal knowledge of the members 
surroundings.
{x
{YAid{x:  The aid component of the quest is to be determined by the 
Leader of the House of Light.  This element of the quest typically 
involves helping others.  Since that Seeker has a long standing 
reputation of being helpful it is integral that Seeker member can 
prove they reflect this reputation adequately.
{x
{yWealth{x:  The wealth component of the quest is simple an amount of
gold determined by the applicants Master and the Grand Master.
{x
{bWisdom{x:  The wisdom component of the quest is to be determined by
the Leaderof the House of Wisdom.  This element of the quest is a show
of deductive ability.  A Seeker must demonstrate their ability to
explore new areas, find and obtain rare items, and pass along knowledge
to the younger members. Typical ways this quest manifests itself is 
through mapping areas, finding craft recipes, or creating mini-helpfiles
for Seeker members to reference.
{x
{RStrength{x:  The strength component of the quest is to be determined
by the Leader of the House of Redemption.  This element is a test of 
strength of character.  It requires the applicant to show prowess in
using their abilities.  Even though Seeker does not actively participate
in pking, it is a necessary element of the world of Redemption.  Every 
member of Seeker attempting to rise in rank should be able to show 
proper prowess of pk with their specific race/class combo.  This can 
take the form of duels or other tasks deemed appropriate by the House
of Redemption.
{x
Quests are to be undertaken as an individual challenge, or a challenge 
for the group, that should be respected as it stands. Anyone caught 
cheating or accepting large amounts of help from someone else towards 
his/her quest will be punished. And remember, if you chose to greatly 
assist someone with a quest that you shouldn't even know about in the
first place, you are just as guilty as the person who cheated by 
accepting your aid.~
1 DRAGONBANE VENARI 'CLAN SPELL' PRAY~
Fearing another invasion of dragonkind, the population of Dominia called
upon Venari to patrol their shores and protect their lands.  All Venari
honour Selina, the goddess who ended the last great war and patron of the
Dominian races.  Calling upon her blessing, members of Venari are able to
better defeat their chosen foes.  Using any weapon or none, the bearer of
Selina's blessing will become the dragonbane.  Her blows will strike true,
aiding her clanmates in their goals.  
 
Syntax: pray dragonbane
 
This spell causes all of the casters physical attacks to deal additional damage
to all kind of dragons. It stacks with a dragonslayer weapon.

All Venari~
1 BROTHERHOOD KENSHI 'CLAN SPELL' PRAY~
When the first members of Kenshi came to Dominia to oppose what they saw
as the oppression of dragons, they had little assistance from anyone except
their own members.  Surrounded on all sides by foes, the Kenshin learned
that they must work as a team to accomplish their goals.  Since that time,
Kenshi have always found strength in numbers.  The strong bond between
Kenshin members has created a strong feeling of brotherhood among them,
allowing people of vastly different levels of skill to work together as a
cohesive unit.  
 
Syntax: pray brotherhood
 
This spell allows members of Kenshi to group with people up to 12 levels away
from them. Using several Kenshi members to boost to cohesiveness of a group, you
can form huge groups with all levels.

All Kenshi~
1 HOMELAND LONER NONCLANNER 'CLAN SPELL' PRAY~
Unlike clan members, Loners and NonClanners do not always have a safe
refuge waiting for them.  Many of them lives as nomads, flitting through the
shadows of society and finding their own small pockets of safety to call
home.  Wandering as free spirits, these people have formed a special bond
with the land they inhabit.  Familiar with its many nuances, they are
comfortable anywhere they travel.  As the old saying goes, "home is where
you make it."  
 
Syntax: pray homeland
 
This spell allows the caster to regenerate extremely quickly even without a clan
hall or guild hall, no matter where they go.

0 BACKSTAB BACK STAB~
syntax:
backstab <target>
bs <target>
{x
Thieves are weak in toe to toe combat, but are masters of the knife in the
back.  Cunning thieves use this skill to strike vital areas whenever the
chance arises, dealing extra damage until the target becomes sufficiently
injured.
{x
Thieves will deal TWO backstabs when hasted, as long as they are wielding
a weapon. Rogues, having focused more on their dexterity to enhance their
ability to steal have lost the ability to have two backstabs. Instead they
can cause a "crippling strike" and deal "critical hits."~
0 HUNTING DOG~
Bounty hunters may call upon the assistance of loyal hounds to track down
their prey.  The hunting dog is a fast moving, automatic hunter that will
track down a target if they are within range, and allow the bounter hunter
to strike a quick surprise attack.

0 MARID~
From deep beneath the dragon sea, the Marid have emerged with stories 
told of horrific destruction, their precious coral cities destroyed 
by an unknown evil. And so, unseen on the surface of Terra and 
Dominia for hundreds of years, the Marid are attempting to salvage 
what is left of their civilization and find a role in the societies 
of the land dwellers. As scattered refugees, the Marid are still few
in number, but more emerge from the sea every week, drawing stares 
wherever they go.
 
Marid could almost pass themselves off as human, but for their 
odd coloration. Marid features include pale white, fish colored 
skin and hair ranging in color from deep sea blue to seaweed green.
Their eyes are double lidded but look otherwise humanoid. Their ears 
are long and pointed, similar to elves, but even larger to help them 
detect changes in water pressure. Marid are generally thin,
and rarely exceed 5 feet in height. They are considered small 
size, and despite their lives spent beneath the waves they do 
not have fins, a tail, or gills.
 
Marid are highly magical creatures, attuned the elements that 
form the world, and make poweful magic users. Despite their frail 
appearance, their nature makes them largely resistant to damage
and they tend to have high hit points for their class. All marids 
are especially skilled in elemental magic and their magical 
essence causes any elemental magic to have additional effects. 
Their command of the sea has given all marid the ability to cast 
the hurricane spell, and they also begin the game knowing how to 
use flails.
 
As creatures of water, Marid enjoy a resistance to both fire 
and water damage, however, they can be easily stricken down by 
electricity. They can travel over both land and water with ease 
and are the only race that can breath both water and air.

0 NEREID MARID REMORT~
All marid have enhanced their elemental powers with regards to 
the sea. They are able to "flood" rooms which will temporarily 
submerge them, causing all characters to have to swim through 
and possibly risk drowning while suffering no penalties themselves.
Remort marid have learned how to use their "condensation" skill to 
use water to heal more quickly while they are submerged. However, 
they are now extremely dependent on water for their survival and 
without it they will quickly die. Remort marid can drink only
water and thirst much more quickly than normal. Any advanced state 
of thirst will deal severe damage to the marid, as their entire 
physical form begins to evaporate.
 
Nereid are mythical creatures who are famous for luring sailors 
to their death beneath the waves with their beauty and their 
magical songs. Nereid may "lure" nearby targets into approaching 
them even against their will, forcing them to travel towards the 
Nereid. Their very soul is said to be contained within a magical 
"shawl" which the Nereid can wear for protection. Not all Nereid 
are evil, however, and they can freely grant "water breathing" to 
any whom they decide to save from drowning.~

Frowned upon by marid society, the befoulers are twisted mutants 
who many consider insane. Befoulers are a slime covered wretches 
who haunt sunken ships and prey upon treasure hunters. With 
their "corruption" spell they can harm their prey and also ruin
any potions, pills, food or drink carried. This vile spell can 
have serious consequences for the unwary. They can also project 
slime onto their victims and use "dissolution" to prevent the 
target from recovering hit points in any way for a short time.~
0 MARID ESSENCE~
Marid are an elemental species and share a powerful connection with
the elements that make up the world. By focusing their essence, Marid
are able to invoke elemental magical effects with additional benefits.
For example, any fire spells cast by Marid can cause fire blind and
destroy potions.

0 FLOOD~
This spell causes the current room to be submerged underwater
temporarily. Be careful, staying in flooded rooms can cause you

0 LURE~
Nereid are well-known for their favourite trick... luring sailors and
other coastal dwellers to a watery grave with their sweet voices.
The lure spell allows the nereid to force any victim within the
current area to approach his position against their will. The
victim who succumbs to the song must constantly struggle against
its effect unless he can travel far enough away to block out the
sound of the song.

0 CORRUPTION~
The polluted touch of a befouler causes deadly infestations and can

1 AVIDE~
Years ago, the Avide sisters were encountered by a Kenshin cleric, who had
betrayed his clan and devoted himself to his own personal war against the clan
Venari as well as clan Kenshi. His name was Demetrius Kokori, a simple man
with a fierce pride. His arrogance lead to his demise by the hands of Venari,
namely Skaleek and Merlyn. Their knowledge of the land and skills in battle
brought Demetrius to the earth, soaked in his own blood. There he rested, more
dead than alive, in the silence of Shandalar's forest. No one came to him, no
one sought him, no one cared. Before death tucked him into its dark pocket, the
forest stirred and the leafs in the trees swayed with the breeze. Three young
ladies, locked arm in arm, floated towards him. Their giggling coming from all
directions in the forest, stirred Demetrius from death. Demetrius squinted
through a mask of hair and dried blood at the three mysterious women. His last
thoughts were perplexed thoughts of these creatures. One adorned in simple
flowers...she was Valeska. Another wore a simple black silk robe, which
like a fire's flame in the morning's sunlight...this was Nightfire. The last
wore gloves of fire, and her feet were covered in water like glass slippers.
Her body was covered in a cloak of ice, like thousands of shattered crystals...
yes, she was Jaina. Perhaps the most confusing realization for Demetrius was
how he knew their names...but it all made sense as the encompassing laughter
stole his mind, and the sisters stole his soul. His eyes void of thought
stared devotedly upon his masters. He was theirs, a puppet of the sisters.
Nightfire's finger extended from the dark coverings of her dark robe, pointed
to the mute man, and curled back in a beckoning motion. Demetrius' body
snapped to attention, forever a slave to the Avide sisters desires.
Like poor Demetrius, so is it for all men who meet the sisters. To be a
part of Avide means to fall victim to their every wish, or, if lucky enough,
to be a young woman chosen by the sisters to reign over the bodies of men...
 
[Avide]
The purpose of the sisters and all members is to help people any way possible.
Avide is about greed and ambition, so charging fees is acceptable, though never
in excess, please.
 
[Rules of Avide]
 
There is only one true rule, that is, to please the sisters. To please the
sisters, one must:
 
-Do not try killing people with extreme overcharges; be fair, promote fun.
 
-Whether your body is captive to Avide or you are captivating bodies, have fun!~

0 PATRON VASSAL PLEDGE ASSUME~
The Patrons and Vassals Point-Sharing System
 
Newcomers to the world we live in need guidance, and those who
provide good guidance can be rewarded. The patron and vassal
system allows characters to share experience points with
each other across large level gaps in a limited way. 
Essentially, this is a master and apprentice type system 
where both members have responsibilities.
 
Becoming the vassal of another character should be a major
decision. Although it can be as easy as entering one 
command, remember that this command costs you many 
things... Every hour you spend, you are donating 6 minutes 
of your time to your patron. If you feel that your patron 
is not deserving of your time or effort, feel free to 
drop them and choose someone more willing to help.
 
Becoming the patron of another character is also a big step.
You should consider yourself a mentor to this character in
both role-play and game-play terms. They provide you with
a steady supply of free experience points, but this should
not come without cost. Your vassal needs equipment and spells
to survive and prosper, and may need much more than that to
learn about our complex world. If you feel your vassal is
not worthy of your help, feel free to drop them and help
others instead.
 
Mechanics:
 
In this system, each character has the choice of a single 
patron and a single vassal. You may be both at once. When
you earn experience points, 10% of these points are converted
into points which are passed onto your patron... which may
be passed onto his patron, and so on.
 
pledge <name>: offer yourself as a vassal to someone
assume <name>: confirm your patronage of potential vassal
 
If things don't work, you can also use:
 
droppatron: free yourself from your patron
dropvassal: withdraw your services as a patron
Your patron/vassal information is displayed in your score.
 
As a vassal, if your patron is online, he will receive his
patron points immediately. If he is not online, you will
accumulate them as vassal points until the next time you are
both on together. They will be transferred then.
 
As a patron, your patron points are not converted into
experience points immediately, and there are restrictions.
You must go to any trainer to convert your current patron
points into experience using:
 
 
gain patron
 
There is a limit to how many patron points you can use 
each level up. This amount is limited to half your 
experience points per level. So a patron who is 5000 exp 
per level can claim up to 2500 exp of his current level 
from vassals, but must still acquire the rest themselves. 
At level 51, you can continue to acquire and use patron 
points to empower intelligent weapons. At this level, 
the claim limit raises to 10000 experience points and is 
reset each time the patron has an intelligent weapon that 
rises in level.

at fighting against the martial classes, but have no 
special affinity for magic, making it an ideal tool to 
use against them.
 
The biggest strength of the monk lies in the flexibility
of their fighting styles. With great ease they can switch
roles from defensive turtles to high powered damage dealers
and anywhere in between. They require no weapons and function
best without any, although they retain proficiency with exotic
weapons of all kinds.
 
MONK BASICS:
Hand to Hand: The art of open handed fighting. Unlike other
classes, this is the monks primary weapon. They will deal
more damage using their bare hands than any other class,
and they can fully parry and disarm at no penalty while
using them.
Brawling: As experts at open handed fighting, monks are
able to make use of all parts of their body during combat.
The brawling skill reflects this ability, and grants the
monk one additional attack each round if he or she removes
their shield while fighting bare knuckled.
 
MONK DEFAULT:
Kick: A swift kick to deal additional damage between rounds.
Trip: Send your opponent to the floor.
Hide: Remain out of sight while stationary.
Shoulder Throw: Catch and counter anyone attempting to bash.
Chakra: Align your body's energy to heal yourself.
Dodge: Nimbly avoiding attacks.
Stances: A variety of fighting style for all situations.
Chi blasts: Several direct damage blasts based on light,
holy or negative energy. Have additional effects.
Spirits: Enhances the monk's fists with elemental energy.
Also protects him by triggering that element when he is
attacked.
Boost: Striking with a loud kiai to boost your next round
of attacks.~
0 SAMURAI MONK~
Without a feudal system to restrict their actions, modern
samurai still do their best to follow a strict code of honor.
Samurai start out weak, but as they advance, they unlock the
ability to use katanas and sheathes. These blades are 
legendary in power but take great effort to maintain and
upgrade. Samurai must continously craft and reforge their
katanas throughout their advancement in order to succeed.
The samurai fighting style is unique, relying on very few
blows to slay a foe, and instead focusing on intensity
and accuracy to make the most of the hair-splitting katana.
 
-Stance: Kensai: A stance that strongly boosts accuracy.
-Katana: The weapon skill to use katanas. May be specialized.
-Doublestrike: Allows a successful strike with the katana
to deal damage twice.
-Extreme Damage: Increases the base damage done. 
-Third Eye: Transfer your blindess to your foe.
-Quicken: Speed yourself up, while slowing your foe.
-Seppuku: Ritual suicide. Greatly raises hit/dam for a
short time, until the ritual is completed, then you die.~
0 NINJA MONK~
Working in the shadows, ninjas are a mysterious class with
a very powerful mixture of tanking and support abilities.
Renowned for their talents in assassination and espionage,
monks who take up the life of a ninja are forever marked
as outlaws by the civilized towns and are attacked on sight by
locals. Ninjas have developed strong talents with exotic
weapons and use them most often. Ninjas have their own
brand of "magic" called ninjitsu, which they use to attack
and render foes susceptible to further attacks. They can
also support allies by restoring mana, and tank physical
attacks better than any other class due to their evasion
and other skills.
 
-Stance: Shadow: Become undetectable during combat, but
more vulnerable to magic.
-Dual Wield: Can use two weapons (usually exotics)
-Evasion: Defends against the next attack(s) that would
have hit you.
-Blindfighting: Suffers no skill penalties while blind.
-Balance: Automatically recover any stunning attack.
-Cycle: Gives some of your mana to your target.
-Ninjitsu: Uses up a charm to inflict damage and add a
vulnerability to the target.~
0 BRAWLING~
syntax: none, automatic ability.
 
Monks are experts in open handed fighting, and able to use many
parts of their bodies as weapons. This ability is reflected in
this skill, which functions similar to dual wield. Whenever a
monk is fighting unarmed and removes his or her shield, they
will make use of the offhand to make an additional unarmed
attack each round.
 
Learned by:
Monk~
0 BOOST~
syntax: boost (during battle only)
 
By using a loud kiai, or battle cry, monks are able to attack more
effectively for one round immediately following the boost. Using this
ability repeatedly can wear the monk out, but it offers a large boost in
hitroll and damroll for that brief moment, and remains a strong ability
throughout the monk's career.
 
Learned by:
Monk~
0 SHOULDER THROW~
syntax: none, automatic skill.
 
Monks are nimble enough to use momentum against their foes. Anyone
who attempts to bash a monk could find themselves flat on the ground as
the monk catches them and slams them to the floor. This ability damages
the opponent and stuns them instead of the monk.
 
Learned by:
Monk~
0 CHAKRA~
syntax: chakra
 
The monk's strength is not purely physical, but also extends to the spirit.
The various energies of the body are known as chakra, and monks are
attuned enough to manipulate their own chakra in order to gain a surge
of health. The technique is advanced and requires time between each use,
but can be used to help the monk recover from many serious injuries.
Monks cannot manipulate the chakras of others, only their own.
This ability is similar to the paladin skill, lay hands.

Monk~
0 CHI MOONLIGHT WHIRLWIND WHISPER~
syntax: chi <ability> [target]
{x 
The chi abilities represent powerful blasts of spirit energy
that can be summoned by the monk.
{x
MOONLIGHT: A shaft of whitish moon light will be focused at 
the target. In addition to its normal damage, the chi blast 
will be amplified based on the monk's life force.
 {x
WHISPER: Uttering a vile word of hatred will surround the
target with bands of negative energy. If unable to resist,
the target will have some of its strength and dexterity 
drained and given back to the monk. The dark whisper 
cannot be resisted.
 {x
WHIRLWIND: The strongest and slowest chi blast. The monk
focuses intensely for a round before whirling in a complete
circle and radiating this holy wind. The wind is able to
drain dexterity and give it back to the monk if it is not 
resisted. The whirlwind continues to grow in size and 
engulfs all targets in the room.
 {x
Each chi blast uses movement.

Monk~
0 STANCE TURTLE TIGER MANTIS SHADOW KENSAI~
syntax: stance <name>
 
The stances represent a collection of open handed fighting
styles that the monk uses. Monks can freely change between
stances as the situation changes, making them extremely
flexible and able to respond to many situations. The only
weakness in stances is that they are quite specialized,
and the monk cannot do everything well at the same time.
All monks can learn the three basic stances, and there are
two additional advanced stances learned by reclasses.
 
TURTLE: This style emphasizes body hardening and endurance.
The monks fists become as tough as solid iron, allowing him
to deal crushing attacks that can stun foes occasionally.
The body hardening also increases the monk's maximum hp
by a significant amount while the stance is in use.
 
TIGER: This style emphasizes speed and is very aggressive.
The monk will attack with a series of vicious chops and
slashes, and gains one additional attack each round. Hitroll 
and damroll will also increase. However, the monk's defenses
(dodge, parry, shield block) will all be severely reduced.
 
MANTIS: This style emphasizes blocking and movement. The
monk will attack with a series of thrusting jabs and kicks,
but most of the effort will be on defense. The monks armor
class will increase, and he will have a high chance to
guard against any weapon attacks. However, the monk's
damage will be severely reduced.
 
SHADOW: An advanced stance used by ninjas to confound
their foes. The ninja will become completely undetectable
as long as he is fighting, phasing in an out and attacking
out of nowhere. While fighting as a shadow, the ninja
becomes especially vulnerable to magic.
 
KENSAI: An advanced stance used by samurais to emphasize
the katana. Kensai means "sword saint" and enables the
samurai to attack very accurately while it is used. In
addition to increasing hitroll, the stance also allows
samurai to penetrate most defenses. The extreme
concentration required prevents all chance at fleeing
as long as the stance is maintained.

Monks

Ninja ~
0 SPIRIT EAGLE DRAGON DOLPHIN~
syntax: dragon, dolphin, eagle as appropriate.
 
In addition to summoning chi and controlling chakras, monks
can manifest one other spiritual power, those of animals.
 
By calling upon the spirits of various animals, monks are
able to imbue their fists and bodies with one element.
While using the spirit, all of the monks hand to hand
attacks will be flagged with the appropriate element, and
anyone attacking the monk may also suffer from the
elemental effects.
 
Monks can change spirits freely, but can only use one at
a time.
 
DRAGON SPIRIT: empowers the monk with flames.
DOLPHIN SPIRIT: empowers the monk with water.
EAGLE SPIRIT: empowers the monk with electricity.
 
Learned by:
Monk~
0 PAIN TOUCH~
syntax: pain <target>
 
With a simple jab or slap, monks are able to induce tremendous pain in their
victims by striking vital pressure points, or giving a sharp tug to dislocate joints. 
This ability causes no physical injury in itself, but it causes the victim to perform
all skills more poorly than normal until the pain subsides. This ability does not
affect spellcasting.
 
Learned by:
Monk~
0 WEAPON CATCH~
syntax: none, automatic ability.
 
Fighting with both hands free, monks are able to perform an expert disarm in
which they have a chance to catch the weapon of anyone they successfully
disarm, ending with the weapon in their inventory.
 
Note: you must know how to disarm to use this ability.
 
Learned by:
Monk~
0 INTENSE DAMAGE~
The raw physical strength developed from using the body
itself as a weapon allows monks to deal additional damage
with each attack. Intense damage increases the base damage
done by all attacks from a monk, including hand to hand
and weapons. It stacks with enhanced damage and extreme
damage.
 
Learned by:
Monk~
0 EVASION~
Syntax: evade
 
Ninjas have developed reflexes far beyond those of other
characters. By concentrating intently on incoming attacks
for a round, a ninja is able to easily sidestep any weapon
attacks that would have connected.
 
Essentially, you may spend movement points to block
incoming attacks. This skill does not block any spells
or other skills.
 
Learned by:
Ninja~
0 BLINDFIGHTING~
Syntax: none, automatic ability.
 
After much practice, ninjas are able to fight without
penalty while blinded. Using their other senses allows
them to fight normally without the use of their eyes.
Ninjas cannot actually see while blinded, but none of 
their skills are penalized.
 
Learned by:
Ninja~
0 BALANCE~
Syntax: none, automatic ability.
 
Using a quick acrobatic flip, ninjas are able to spring
to their feet and resume fighting without penalty at the
start of any round where they were knocked down and stunned
by any such attack. This ability allows ninja to recover
more quickly from the devastating stun inflicted by bash,
trip, lightning or other stunning effects.
 
Learned by:
Ninja~
0 CYCLE~
Syntax: cycle <target>
 
Their own brand of magic does not require magic, and ninjas
have learned how to siphon off their own mana and share it
with others. This ability allows you to give up your own
mana and give it to others, making the ninja a very handy
character to have around.
 
Learned by:
Ninja~
0 NINJITSU~
Syntax: ninjitsu <tool> [target]
 
Ninjas have developed a series of tools, called charms,
that they can use to great effect. Although it is not magic,
as it does not require the use of mana, ninjitsu inflicts
a variety of damage types. The strongest effect of ninjitsu
is that most charms inflict a vulnerability to a particular
type of damage in addition to their own damage. Using the
ninja charms in the correct order can maximize their damage.
In addition, ninjitsu is very fast since it does not require
any casting time. However, it is not very reliable, and fails
often.

Ninja~
0 KATANA~
This is the weapon skill needed to wield katana class weapons
effectively. It may be specialized.
 
Learned by:
Samurai~
0 DOUBLESTRIKE~
Syntax: none, automatic skill.
 
Samurai are fierce and accurate with higher level katanas,
and are able to deal damage twice with a single hit. Note
that this is not the same as second attack. If the first
strike hits, the second strike will also hit and deal the
exact same damage. Samurai may only doublestrike while
wielding a katana, no other weapon has this capability.
 
Learned by:
Samurai~
0 EXTREME DAMAGE~
Syntax: none, automatic skill.
 
Samurai alone can strike with the accuracy required by this
skill. Extreme damage raises the base damage done by all
attacks from the samurai, including hand to hand and weapons.
It stacks with enhanced damage and intense damage.
 
Learned by:
Samurai~
0 THIRD EYE~
Syntax: third
 
This mystical skills allows the samurai to overcome blindness
using their spiritual skills. A brilliant third eye will flash
brightly in the centre of the samurai's forehead, allowing
him to see again, and his foe will be blinded in turn.
 
This skill allows you to transfer any type of blindess
from yourself to the target you are fighting.
 
Learned by:
Samurai~
0 QUICKEN~
Syntax: quicken
 
This mystical skills allows the samurai to fight with
a sudden burst of speed. The samurai will accelerate so
rapidly, that those he is fighting will appear to move 
in slow motion.
 
This skill hastes yourself and slows your opponents at
the same time.
 
Learned by:
Samurai~
0 SEPPUKU~
Syntax: cast 'seppuku'
 
This is a samurai's last chance at success. Known as the
ultimate "final protest", once the ritual of Seppuku has
started, the samurai becomes filled with a powerful surge
of strength for a few moments before taking their own
lives. The standard method of seppuku involves self
disembowelment, following by beheading, and is obviously
always fatal.
 
The gods smile on those who give their lives in this
way, and the character will not leave behind a corpse,
and appear with all equipment intact.

1 DEATHBLOW MARK ASSASSINATE~

Syntax: assassinate
{x
Assassins have learnt the art of Deathblow. Using his mastery in sneak and 
concealment, an assassin studies and marks his victim from the shadows, before 
finally striking a deadly blow to the back of the neck, inflicting massive 
amounts of damage and stunning his victim for several rounds.

54 AURA~
Syntax: cast aura <victim> <red or blue or none>
 
This spell is for immortal use only and was desigened for the
CTF arena to make teams, one red or one blue. The spell has no
set duration so be sure to remove it from the players afterwards.~
54 RPTITLE TITLE RECOGNITION ROLE PLAY~
Recognition titles are titles which appear before your name, but after your 
clan affiliation on the who list.  These titles can be awarded in a number
of different ways.  They are always used to recognize a social status, 
accomplishment or title.  
{x
Recognition titles can be awarded as follows:
{x
1. You may ask one of the Immortal to evaluate your claim to recognition of 
your title or accomplishment.  This will usually be done through a quest which 
will challenge your claim.  These quests are typically much more strenuous 
than the typical quests you would receive.
2. You may prove to the Immortal through a petition or list that you are 
commonly recognized by a given title, or recognized for your accomplishment.
  The Immortal will evaluate your claim and either announce your new Title, 
or decline your claim.  
3. Most Recognition Titles are Unique.  As such, the [Hero of Midgaard] 
could only be held by one person at a time.  Should you wish to claim this 
title, a challenge will be issued to both you--to prove you deserve it--, 
and to the current holder, to prove they are the rightful holder.  
Challenges must be issued simultaneously by note to both the Immortal and to
the current title holder.  
{x
All recognition titles will require role-play justification.  This will be 
unique to everyone, and as such there are no clean guidelines of what would
be sufficient justification for one person.  Regardless, retaining a 
Recognition Title is an honour, and the bearer should ensure that their 
every action reflects their title.  Titles which no longer apply to someone
will be removed.
{x
Recognition titles can be lost/removed in the following ways:
1. Your title is challenged and you fail to defend it as identified by the
Immortal.  This includes failing to respond to a challenge within an assigned
time limit.
2. Inappropriate titles will be removed immediately.  If you have to clarify
if your title is appropriate, it isnt.  These titles should not have been
recognized in the first place.  Inappropriateness is as defined by the
Immortal, but all profanity can be immediately assumed inappropriate.
3. A failure to live up to your title for an extended period can also result
in having it removed.  This is at the discretion of the Immortals.
{x
A few guidelines for Recognition Titles:
1. Recognition titles should be titles in that they can ideally be read
before your name, or in substitution of your name.  Similarly, they should
be short, usually consisting of one to two words (An adjective and a noun,
typically).
2. Involving your new Title subtly into your characters personality is
highly recommended, and will increase your chance of retaining it.
3. Remember: Recognition titles are not only a privilege; they must be
maintained at all times.  They are by no means a right.
4. Very special events run by the Immortals may result in a new Recognition
title being awarded to the Victor.~
1 FIXCP~
This is a command that can be used anytime before you become level 25. 
It was originally implimented to fix a bug which incorrectly calculated how
much experience was required per level.  It currently does NOT need to be
used, so don't use it.  If you have gained any skills or skill groups and
use this command, you will be required to gain all the extra experience you
missed, so again, it is STRONGLY advised you do not use this command.  ~
1 WARPSTONES~
Warpstones are an ancient magic that can be tapped as a power source for
some of the more powerful transportation spells.  No one quite knows when
these items were made, or by whom; but some do remain scattered about the
world.  ~
0 DRUNKEN MASTER~
The loneliness of mountain living has caused many mountain dwarves to become
heavy drinkers. Rather than a weakness, the dwarves have turned this into an
advantage. While fighting intoxicated, all mountain dwarves deal increased
damage, and also feel pain less acutely.~
0 LESSER DISPEL~
Syntax: cast 'lesser dispel' <victim>
{x
This spell is similar to dispel as it can be used to remove magical
effects from a target. This version of the spell can only be cast against
NPCs and not against players. Like dispel, it does not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.
{x
This skill is for reclasses only.
{x
Learned by:
Templar~
0 UNHUSH~
Syntax: unhush <player>
{x
This will remove the player from your hush list, allowing you to hear
them once again.
(see also 'help hush')~
0 SPAM SPAMMING~
Spamming is a common practice where a character tries to practice a skill
by using it over and over again (as there is a chance you will get better at
it), rather than using a practice session.  While the imms do not approve of
this, we won't stop it unless our spam warnings go off, consider yourself
warned.  
(see 'help rules' for more information)~
0 'CURE PLAGUE' CURE PLAGUE~
Syntax: cure <character> 
{x
This skill will cure someone's disease, and prevent the disease from
spreading even further then it might have already.
{x
Learned by:
Cleric     Paladin~
0 LOST PASSWORD~
If you have lost the password for a character you own don't fret, all
isn't lost.  Contact a level 59+ imm (Starcrossed, Cauthon) and they can
reset the password for you.  Please note that you will be required to
provide as much proof that you actually own the character, so any
information you can tell them about the character will help your case.  ~
58 CREATION POINTS CP~
Creation points are what determine your amount per level when your
character is created.  The higher the number, the more experience per level
the character will be.  If you gain skills after creation, your total amount
of creation points will increase, but you will not have an increase in your
amount per level until remort or reclass.  If you want to see the amount of
creation points your character has or what groups they have gained type
"info".  
(see 'help gain', 'help info')~
0 INFO~
Syntax: info
{x
This command will display what skill or spell groups your character
currently has. It will also display the total amount of creation
points for the character.

1 STUN~
Syntax: cast 'stun' <victim>
{x
Adept magic users are able use their magic to create magical bands
that can surround their victim and crush them slightly. While this
spell does not deal any damage to the victim, it does stun them
temporarily.~
1 CRITICAL HITS~
Rogues have lost a lot of their brute strength and as such are unable to
make two backstabs while hasted.  Their added nimbleness has enabled them to
get "critical hits" on their victims with any attack they use.  The extra
damage dealt is proportional to the level of the thief.  This skill is
automatic during all attacks.

Syntax: cast 'minor revitalize' <target>
{x        cast 'lesser revitalize' <target>
{x        cast 'greater revitalize' <target>
{x
Druids have learned to harness the power of nature in order to promote
healing. By casting one of the three revitalize spells their wounds will

1 LEAF SHIELD~
Syntax: cast 'leaf shield'
{x
Using a clever blend of nature and magic druids have been able to
create a "leaf shield." This shield is made of magic leaves that can
deflect magical spells cast against the wearer. Since the leaves are so
thin they are not able to deflect much magic before it is torn.

Druids~
1 MARKSMANSHIP~
Syntax: shoot <target>
{x
If a ranger is wielding a ranged weapon, they can use their
"marksmanship" skill.  To fire, the player must be holding the appropriate
type of ammo and use the "shoot" command.  Depending on the weapon, they can
shoot from a great distance, however ranged weapons prove useless when in
close combat.  This skill can be further maximized by using "aiming" and
"barrage" skills.

0 DAISY DELSTAR~
The two original IMPs of the mud.  They started Redemption up after

1 SEEKER HOUSES~
Houses:
{x
Upon attaining Journeyperson rank, a Seeker may ask to enroll into one of
three houses that each have different goals and responsibilities. After 
being given a sample of each of these three houses through their
Apprenticeship to a Master, a Journeyperson can then make a good decision
about which  field they would like to professionalize in under the
instruction of the House Master. The three houses are the House of Light,
the House of Wisdom, and the House of Redemption, and each is described
below.
{x
{YHouse of Light{x:
{x
Members of the House of Light are the epitome of what Seeker has become.
We aim to give aid to all throughout the land whenever we are able and 
seek to enable Seekers in their own quests for personal achievement.
Members of the House of Light would be the first people to which member
of both Seeker and other clans would turn to for aid. While it is expected
that all Seekers should attempt to aid any who ask, sometimes situations
arise where aiding someone at that moment is not practical (ie. retrieving
a corpse, running from an attacker, busy in a far away area, etc.) In such
situations, you would refer the player to a different member of the House 
of Light or available Seeker.
{x
What tasks can be done? Here are a few tasks that all members of the House 
of Light are expected to perform, as outlined by the House Master.
{x
1) Aid to Seekers:
We in the House of Light will strive to make members of clan Seeker the
best equipped characters in the lands.  This means we will go to great 
lengths to gather equipment from the farthest corners of the land, as well
as craft rare items required by those who ask.  If there is some piece of
equipment that a Seeker desires or needs he/she will be asked to submit a
personal note to the House Master, and that Master will delegate 
responsibility of gathering the item(s) and/or the ingredients to others
within the house.  If the item is easily obtainable by the requesting
member it is the duty of the House of Light to teach the member to
retrieve the item(s). As for Quest equipment, if any member of the House
of Light has extra quest points to use for other members proper
compensation is entitled. However, there are no requirements that members
of the House of Light must utilize quest points for such expenditures.
{x
2) Aid to Others:
All of the above items will be available to other inhabitants of Terra and
Dominia, but the House of Light Member is allowed to charge for
their services.  This charge will take the form of a donation by the
recipient to clan Seeker.  The amount of the donation is at the discretion
of the House of Light Member performing the service.
{x
Any Journeyperson may apply to enter the House of Light by contacting the
House Master, but you should be both polite and friendly, along with being
willing to help whenever a situation arises. In doing so, good relations
with other clans are promoted, and you have made the world a nicer and
kinder place for someone, which is a rewarding experience.
{x
{bHouse of Wisdom{x:
{x
Since Seeker is a clan of knowledge and enlightenment, the House of Wisdom
plays an important role in improving the clan's insight and social status.
Members of the House of Wisdom should possess good analytical and 
exploration skills, have the constant desire to improve, gain further 
knowledge, and be able to express themselves clearly. They should also be
concerned with the clan's development and social status, being dedicated
to improving it by means of amassing knowledge and promoting good relations
with other clans.
{x
1) Discovery:
First and foremost members of the House of Wisdom are commissioned to 
venture out into this world and discover.  This discovery can take many
forms.  It can take the form of maps, craft lists, etc.  Discovery is how
we Seekers survive in todays world.  We learn and seek out that which
can aid us in being a stronger, more cohesive unit.  The passing down of
this knowledge and the grooming of others with a passion for discovery is
essential to the House of Wisdom and Seeker in general.
{x
2) Knowledge:
The House of Wisdom has been known for it collective knowledge.  Passing 
down of this knowledge is another element of the growth that each Seeker
must receive.  Knowledge of this sort is to find itself in many forms
such as; building advice helpfiles on equipment to wear, leveling areas,
knowledge of equipment held by creatures and how to obtain it most
effectively, etc. Knowledge is not always attained from what weve
already experienced, sometimes it is in the thinking up of new ideas.
This seeking of new ideas is an integral part of being a member of the
House of Wisdom.
{x
{RHouse of Redemption{x:
{x
The House of Redemption is designed to help Seeker's members become more
comfortable and knowledgeable in the pkilling environment, therefore
decreasing losses and discouraging other clans from attacking Seekers.
Members of the House of Redemption must be dependable and trustworthy,
willing to teach and help others, and possess good judgment and common
sense. Members must also be willing to learn, and must at the same time 
be able to pass on their knowledge and guidance to others. The most
common task will be to help members deal with pkill situations, providing
them with advice should the event happen again, and giving general tips
on survival and escape. Should the need arise, members of the House of
Redemption are permitted to exercise the rules on clan defense, only if
they have permission from a Master who had summoned them to aid.
{x
1) Clan Defense:
Members of the House of Redemption are allowed to fight enemies of clan
Seeker with the intent of defending the clan.  If a member of Seeker 
calls for aid against an aggressor any member of the House of Redemption
who isable to assist may take up arms against the aggressor until the
members of clan Seeker are safe.  Defense against hall breaks and other
forms of attacks are also within the venue of the House of Redemption.
{x
2) Knowledge:
Contrary to what may be inferred, the House of Redemptions overall
goal is one of education and guidance, remaining true to Seeker's stance;
not one of violence, threatening, and deceit. The house doesn't not have
free reign we are still under the same guidelines, and The House of
Redemption rules do not supercede out core beliefs.  On this note, all
members of the House of Redemption are called upon to teach, and guide
members of clan Seeker in the ways of self-defense.  The world of
Redemption is a scary and sometimes violent place and members of Seeker
should be adept at keeping themselves safe.  The duty of teaching such
skills and tactics falls upon the talents of the House of Redemption
and those who lie within it.
{x
{x
All houses are responsible for two other duties equally.
{x
Leveling Assistance:
When time allows it, members of the House of Wisdom may be called upon
to assist others in their leveling endeavors.  As there may be no
requirement of House of Wisdom members to assist, doing so will help to
build camaraderie within clan Seeker and foster amicable relationships
with other clans.
{x
Clan Wealth:
Another function of the House of Redemption is to fill the clan coffers.
There are many upgrades and changes in constant flux that will benefit
clanSeeker, but they are costly.  Members of the House of Redemption are
as responsible as the other members of clan Seeker to aid in the
acquisition of clan funds.~
56 RESTRING~
This helpfile is designed to take you through the motions of how to do a
proper restring.  Restrings are to be done when a player cashes in a voucher
for them.  They can also be handed out for rp quests, tournaments and other
quests. Make sure the following fields are filled in when you do one:
Short: this is what is seen in the person's inventory, when they are
wearing it etc.
Long: this is what is seen when it is on the ground, make sure it matches
the short desc in some way, so a person can identify it.
keywords: (aka name) make sure you KEEP the original keywords of the item,
so that it can easily be identified. Add in any keywords that seem logical
to add due to the new 'short' field, as well add your name and the player's
name who you are restringing it for.
Do not forget to make sure the item has a no_sac flag on it as well.
{x
Remember when doing a restring, make it appropriate, do not do stupid
stuff or words that should be censored etc.~
1 ROOM SECTOR~
The following is a list of room sectors available on Redemption.
city               field              forest             hills 
swamp              mountain           swim               noswim   
air                desert             inside             underwater~
0 JUDGEMENT JUSTICE 'CLAN SPELL' PRAY~
Members of Justice have long fought a war against the followers of Carnas
who blesses his followers with ways to avoid punishment for their crimes. 
Summoning the spirit of Justice, members of the clan gain the ability to act
as judge, jury and executioner of the followers of Carnas.  While rendering
judgement, the caster is able to see the mark of Carnas on any players in
the room, and attack them without suffering a killer flag.  The victim does
not have to be under Carnas' blessing for this to happen, if they worship
Carnas, the members of Justice can exact punishment for past or future
crimes.  
{x
Syntax: pray judgement
 {x
This spell allows members of Justice to attack anyone who worships Carnas 
without getting a killer flag. They can still only attack players in their 
normal range.
{x 
Learned by:
All Justice~
0 SHADOW MAGIC~
Illusionists have managed to master the ability to make their illusions
seem almost real at times.  This power has become so pronounced that
occasionally when they cast a spell, the shadow of it can be felt.  This
shadow magic is essentially the same spell, though it is a bit weaker than
the original.  When shadow magic is used it is automatic and does not cost
the illusionist any extra mana. ~
1 MISTY CLOAK~
Syntax: cast 'misty cloak' <character>
{x
Mist dragons have gained the ability to cloak themselves and their allies in
a protective mist. This mist obscures the character and provides an AC and
dexerity bonus.
{x
This is a remort spell only.~
56 RPTITLE TITLE RECOGNITION ROLE PLAY~
Recognition titles are not Rptitles, although they will be placed using 
the rptitle command.
{x
Syntax is as follows:
{x
Rptitle <player> <title>
{x
Titles may only be 20 characters long.  Use quotes around the title if it
is multiple words.  To reset someones title, use . In the <title> area.
{x
Old Rptitles from before 23/12/05 are to be removed on sight.  
{x
Recogntition titles can still be used to include guild rankings, but 
should avoid clan ranks as much as possible.  This is what the rank 
command is for.
{x
Recognition titles should never be given out as a reward for a tourney 
or simple quest.  They can not be given out by voucher, as this would 
circumvent the point of making them difficult to get, and unique.  When 
given out for an event, it must be a special event, run by Immortals, and
requires significant effort on the part of Mortals to receive it.
{x
Recognition titles can also be given out to players who role-play.  They
must petition for the title, and be given a quest which is related to their
title.  This quest should be long and convoluted, perhaps taking days-weeks
to complete.  Ideally it should test out their role-playing dedication in
some way, while also not forcing them to do anything they are not 
interested or comfortable doing.  
{x
Recognition titles are unique.  For instance, if one mortal is the 
[Sliver King] and another mortal wishes to challenge for it, they are 
allowed to do so.  Challenges should be difficult, as outlined above for 
initially receiving the title.  Both the title holder, and the challenger 
should receive the same challenge.
{x
If you have any questions about the above, contact the Imps. ~
56 "CAPTURE THE FLAG" CTF~
Capture the flag is a special kind of tournament which can be run, where
the entire mechanics are hardcoded into the system.  The game works by
establishing two teams, red and blue.  The immortal will add players to the
team, the goal of the game being to go into the enemy's base, get their
flag, and return it to your own base to score a point.  The flag can be
picked up off the ground, but cannot be stolen.  When holding the flag,
players will move more slowly.  
 
There are six commands immortals can use to run the game.
 
add. Syntax: ctf add <player> <red / blue>
This takes the specified player, adds them to their team's prep room, and
puts them into their team.
 
start. Syntax: ctf start
This places the two flags on the ground, and transfers all members of the
team into their base.
 
remove. Syntax: ctf remove <player>
If a player's leaving, this removes them from the game and their team,
dropping their flag if they have it and putting them back in their hall.
 
end. Syntax: ctf end
Ends the game. Clears the score, removes all flags, and puts everyone
who's playing back in their clan halls.
 
score. Syntax: ctf score
Displays the score to you. 
 
set. Syntax: ctf set <red/blue> <number>
Sets the score of the designated team to what the specified parameter is.~
1 OFFER OWNERSHIP CLAIM QUEST CRAFT~
All quested and crafted items are bonded with the one who first obtains
them by completing the crafted item, or raising the necessary quest points.
This information is plainly visible to anyone who closely examines these
items. The gods will reward those who have earned these items by not
allowing any other being to maintain possession of the claimed item should
they fall.
OOC: This means that Items claimed to a person other than the person
who is currently in possession of it, will have it remain in their corpse with
the potions, pills, etc.
 
 
The 'offer' command allows you to transfer full ownership of your items to
someone else, at a cost. The person receiving ownership of the items will
have to sacrifice gold (for crafted items) or qp (for quest items) to gain the
favours of the gods and complete the transfer of ownership. The fee varies,
but is higher for transferance between clanners and non-clanners.
Syntax:
 
OFFER <item> <player>: Allows the player to know the item is being
offered, and what sacrifice is required to gain ownership of it.
OFFER ACCEPT: Allows the player to notify that they are willing to make
the sacrifice and they want the item.
OFFER REFUSE: Allows the player to notify that the sacrifice is too much
or they do not want the item.
Once a player has indicated that they accept the offer, the person offering
the item repeats OFFER <item> <player> one more time and the transfer
will be completed.

1 CAPTURE THE FLAG CTF TOURNAMENT COMMANDS~
CTF SCORE
-This command will display the score of the game
{x
CTF CAPTURE
-When you bring the enemy flag back to your flag room, you must type CTF CAP 
to capture the flag.  This awards you a point and returns the flag to the enemy base. ~
0 HARMONIC AURA SEEKERS 'CLAN SPELL' PRAY~
Seekers are well known for their peaceful nature and their generous
assistance of others.  Most Seekers have learned to rely on the protection
of their patron, Bhaal, to allow them to escape from harm.  The spirit of
Seeker can imbue its members with a holy aura of harmony that will shelter
the members of their group.  Aggressors will find they cannot summon the
willpower to strike down one who is protected by the aura...  However they
can still strike at the source of the aura.  The aura is short ranged, and
will only protect group members who stand near the source of the harmonic
aura.  
{x
Syntax: pray harmonic aura
{x
This spell prevents other members of your group from being attacked by players
and also from attacking any players as long as they are in the room with you.
It does not protect the caster from harm, however.
{x
Learned by:
All Seekers~
1 CAPTURE THE FLAG CTF TOURNAMENT~
Capture the Flag is a new type of tournament. It is designed as strategy
game where players will be split into two teams, {RRed{x and {BBlue{x. 
{x
The {RRed{x team is required to retrieve the the {BBlue{x flag, and kill
the {BBlue{x Jail Keeper to free team mates. And vice versa.
{x
{x
Objective - The Flag
--------------------
The objective of the game is to bring the other team's flag to your own 
flag room. While you have the flag (which is an item), you will experience 
1 round of  lag per room. When you bring the enemy flag into your flag room, 
you will be lagged 8 rounds before you can use any commands. This will give 
the opposing team a last attempt to stop you.
{x
The person holding a flag will have a (CTF Flag) in front of their name when 
you look at them. To recapture your stolen flag, simply kill the person 
holding it and they will drop it.  If someone on your team picks up your flag, 
it is returned to your flag room. If an enemy picks up your flag, they can 
continue trying to run home.  
{x
{x
Death - Jails
-------------------
When you die in the CTF arena, instead of being removed from the game, you 
are sent to jail. Upon being sent to the jail, a timer will count a set amount 
of ticks until you're automatically let out. Although, the best way to 
'escape' from jail is if one of your team mates sneaks into the enemy 
base and kills the Jail Keeper. Once the Jail Keeper is killed, all prisoners
are sent back to their own home base.  
{x
{x
-------------------
Throughout the game, appropriate warnings will be displayed, telling you 
when a flag is taken, captured, or returned and also when a prison is unlocked.
{x
Games play to a maximum score or length of time determined by the Immortal 
running the CTF. Rules for combat are as dictated by the Immortal running the 
game, but if nothing is announced, you must assume they are as per the rules 
in 'HELP TOURNAMENT'.  Breaking rules through ignorance is still grounds 
for being kicked out of a game, which will leave your team at a disadvantage. 
Game participation is at the Immortal's discretion.~
1 HALLOW~
A templar being the holiest of knights, may kneel down and send up a prayer to
his god asking to cleanse the ground that he stands upon.  This cleansing will
remove any and all affects in the room instantaneously.
 
Learned by:
 
Templar~
1 PURIFY~
To aid others and oneself through purification are part of a templars belief.
Through the use of this skill the templar will remove any ill-affection that
himself or another is afflicted by.  There is a catch however, the templar
cannot determine which order they are removed.  Each ill-affection must come
off in the order of last to first.
 
 
Learned by:
 
Templar~
54 WAR DRAGONWAR~
The world is at War.  The Children of Bosco and Selina who walk among you have
extended their hands and have decided more direct action is needed.
During this time of War, they have declared Martial-Law.  Some old taboos are
now considered practical, but there are also new virtues among those who
fight.
 
{R1.{x  No one is neutral.  Only Non-clanners may take haven in the city of
Stoneridge.  All clanners or loners alike must choose to support either Bosco
or Selina.  Trying to play both sides displeases the Gods and risk their wrath.
 
{R2.{x Loyalty is rewarded.  Disloyalty is cowardly.  If you are part of a
clan, leaving that clan for any reason is frowned upon by the Gods and risks
their severe wrath.  Support your clan, and the Immortals on your side may
smile upon you.
 
{R3.{x People who do not support your side cannot be trusted:  Clans may
only recruit from clans of the same faction (Bosco/Selina).  New arrivals to
this world may be recruited by anyone, however as per Rule 2, shall not be
lonered.
 
{R4.{x An army is only as good as its General.  If a Clan Leader Outcasts
members from the army of (Selina/Bosco) this shall anger their Gods, and
they will be held accountable.
 
{R5.{x If your soul inhabits multiple bodies, and, in the midst of battle seeks
a different form, this will severely anger the Gods.  Before two armies meet
at a predetermined time to fight, ensure your soul is not restless, and is
content to remain in that body for the entirety of that battle.~
1 WORSHIP FAVOR FAVOUR~
Pacifism:  While under the effect of "pacifism", you are safe from any
player's attacks.  However, if you attack some one the affects of pacifism
wear off. For nonclanners, pacifism allows you to take less damage from mobs
you are fighting.
 
Injustice:  "injustice" lets you attack players, in your range, without
getting a (KILLER) flag.  Also, people can attack you without getting a
(KILLER) flag. For nonclanners, this effect grants you extra gold from
the mobs you kill.
 
Gullivers travel: Allows you to "recall dominia" or  "recall terra".  Also,
when under the affects of "gullivers" your movement will not be halved when
recalling.
 
Detect all:  This favor allows you to see through all forms of mortal
obscurement abilities.
 
Surge:  extends the life of your spells.  While you are under the effect of
surge, only the ticks for "surge" go down in your "affects" list.~
0 UNREMORT UNRECLASS~
Due to changes over time or poor decisions, it is possible to forsake
your remort or reclass so that you may choose another one.
 
In order to do so you must meet the following requirements:
 
-You must be level 51.
-You must acquire a special crafted item (and collect its components).
-You must travel to a special location in the abyssal seam. Full details
will be found in this location.
 
The syntax is:
remort forsake
reclass forsake
 
If you go through with this, you will not be delevelled. All the skills
and spells unique to your current remort will be removed. It will be as
if you had never remorted. Note that if you wish to choose another remort
you must still meet all the normal requirements such as quest points.~

55 AFFECT AFFECTS IMM~
Syntax: affect <character>
Syntax: affect <character> remove <affect>
 
 
This command when used with just a character name will list all the affects
on that character.  When the 'remove' keyword is added, you can remove one
affect from a character.  Consider it a more refined version of 'blank'.
You do not need to be in the same room as your target.
 
See also BLANK.~
59 MANA DRAIN~
Syntax: cast 'mana drain' <victim>
 
By use of this spell, the caster can drain mana from his
victim.~
0 CHARACTER TRADE~
Character trades are now allowed on Redemption.  Such exchanges must be
between characters of equivalent level, and with approximately the same
sophistication of equipment and number of abilities.  Whether a trade is
considered 'fair' or not is to be negotiated between the two parties
involved, and the Immortal doing the trade.  All trades must be approved and
performed by a 58+.  Both affected characters will lose 10 hp/mana/movement.
The characters will be renamed, and it is up to one of the new characters to
post a note stating both the old and new character names to everyone.
 
Note: All claimed equipment will not be adjusted to reflect the new
names.  This means all claimed equipment will be lootable; and this is also
considered a penalty for trading.

0 SHOW~
This command is used to toggle the display of all the spells affecting your
character in your shore. When activated your affects list will be included when
you use the score or or oldscore commands. At low levels, only the spell name
will be displayed. At higher levels, the effects and duration of the spell will
also be shown.
 
(See also: 'help AFFECTS' 'help SCORE' 'help OLDSCORE')~
0 AREA ZONE CONTROL~
Some areas within this world can be claimed and controlled by your guild
or clan.  Having control of an area will show up on 'where,' and will grant
your clan or guild extra regeneration and bonus damage while within that
area.
 
Each area is different; how you can gain control changes.  Sometimes
it may be as easy as killing a key mob, other times it may involve
a complicated quest.  In some areas, there may also be additional
bonuses or disadvantages for controlling the area.
 
Controlling an area is persistent, and will remain until another
group takes it from you. 
 
Current list of areas:
Gingerbread House
Time (casts free haste)
Haon Dor (trees give away location of all but control clan)
High Tower (casts free Aurora)Bosco's Breach (Control grants free passage, and toll collection)Bosco's Breach (control clan gets to cross for free and collect tolls on demand)~

58 IMMGAIN GAIN SKILL SPELL~
Mortals may quest to gain extra abilities.  This is at a cost in QP per
CP.  The formula is as follows:
 
 
Below 500 hours:  2.5kQP/CP
Between 500-1500 hours: Cost reduces by 0.1kQP/CP per 100 hours.
            This cost reduces in steps, not linearly.
Above 1500 hours:  1.5kQP/CP
  
Also note: This formula is to remain secret.  You must always
check their hours and give them the cost for a given skill,
never explain how it works.~
