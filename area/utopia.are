An evil prankster is juggling knives effortlessly.
~
Devoid of any hair on his head, it is easy to see the scar that travels
from the corner of the gargoyle's crooked nose, around the eye socket,
and across his glistening skull. While you examine him, he remains utterly
dispassionate. Even as your eyes widen in horror, his unblinking visage
never changes.

Pale white hair tumbles wildly about pale green shoulders.  Her eyes are
half-lidded, as she watches you examine her with interest.  She is slow to
smile, but when she does, you are taken aback by the carnal intent gleaming
in the depths of her intelligent eyes.

The green man~
The green man is here, hiding from the men of the village.
~
Huddled at the very top of the May Pole, is the forlorn figure of this
year's Green Man.  Supposedly the symbol of male virility, he is at the
heart of the fertility ritual being danced far below.  His job is to run
amongst the women, daring them to chase him...  And if caught, he kisses
them, blessing them with fertility for the coming year.  Unfortunately, this
Green Man was caught kissing a few of the women before today, and their
husbands are none too pleased.

Flowing red hair surrounds a pretty face wreathed in smiles.
Dressed in the finest of garb, she is clothed in silk so soft,
that even the clouds are jealous. Yet she seems totally unaware
of the effect that she has on those who gaze upon her. Instead, 
she is totally focused inward, on her spiritual journey.

A quick glance at this young man, and you realize that he is
not to be trifled with. Chiseled mucles seem to be carved out
of solid rock to form the muscles that ripple across his lean
figure. Glancing at his face, you realize he is staring at you
too, grinning sardonically as you complete your inspection of
his incredible physique. Warm brown eyes twinkle in amusement
at your obvious discomfiture, and he stretches luxuriously as
you approach. He is certainly at ease with his place in life.

A slobbering dog watches you intently as he gnaws on his bone.
~
Power.  Such a simple word.  But so descriptive.  And one of the amazing
things about power, is that you recognize it when you see it.  And this dog
definitely has it.  Power just oozes out of him.  No, it's not the square
set of his shoulders, or the way that he walks with each paw purposefully
striking the ground.  You can't put your finger on it, but this dog
certainly emanates power from his very core, and you would do well to
remember that if you decide to tangle with him, or his master.

mistress, he cares more about his more spiritual pursuits.  However, like
most cats, his idea of spirituality revolves around finding as much sun to
sleep in as possible.

a tiny area without any thorns.  Perhaps the {copening{x is big enough to

blossoming fruit trees laden with juicy fruits, and smiling, happy people.

A grassy road leads northward out of the center of Utopia.  Although it
is not much of a road by the standards of larger cities, it is fairly easy
to traverse.  Indentations caused by wagon wheels can be seen, and the grass
in between them is still quite high.  It is easy enough to surmise that the
folks who follow this road tend to walk within the wagon tracks to avoid any
further harm to their pristine fields.

for even the slightest hesitation which might indicate their opponent's

The Winding Road~
The pathway continues forward, moving inexorably closer to an ancient oak
tree.  Tales have traveled far and wide about the special abilities that
this tree is said to possess.  Many claim that its leaves hold the key to
immortality.  Others scoff at such a grandiose idea, and simply feel that
because of its age it brings good luck to those who take care of it, and
keep it safe.

Yggdrasil~
The tree of life stands here in all its glory.  It is so large that even
a dozen people could not encircle it no matter how hard they tried. 
Branches sway lazily in the light breeze, and the leaves rustle in pleasure
as the wind dances amongst them.  It would appear that the tree is trying to
teach about life and how the world needs to interact at a very basic level
in order to survive and prosper.  The leaves continue to rustle as the tree
weaves a tale of peace and harmony for those who are willing to listen.  It
is a struggle to hear the whisper of the tree amidst all the cacophony of
the rest of the world, but perhaps solitude can be found amongst the higher
{cbranches{x.

Deep Within the Tree of Life~
Darkness surrounds you, wrapping you in its essence like a soft, warm
blanket.  At the most basic of levels, it is understood that there is
nothing to fear here, except for destiny itself.  The choices you are free
to make will shape who you are, and what you become.  Choose wisely, as the
Gods are not appreciative of those who make light of the Dance.

Training Field~
Men and women train side-by-side in the field, their sweat mixing with
the dirt on their faces giving them an almost surreal appearance.  Each is
using a different kind of weapon, from simple swords and knives to more
elaborate items such as katanas.  The students are completely immersed in
their training, focused solely on their opponent, yet they are so skilled
that it is safe to move amongst them and not fear for your life.

Training Field~
Further down the training field a group of men are battling in utter
silence.  With the exception of a muted thump when a blow is landed, these
men do not make a sound.  They are the elite fighters of Utopia -- a
fighting force of men so strong that they require no weapons at all to
defend themselves.  Their only weapons are their hands and their ability to
keep their wits about them in a life or death situation.

is obvious that although this group is known as the "Peacekeepers", they
have spent their lives dedicated to training in the Art of War.

An azure glow surrounds you, as you step out into a field of
energy so pure, that it seems you are breathing it in and out
of your body instead of air. Your muscles begin to relax, and
your mind clears itself of all the tension and stress that has
been bothering you. You are aware of a hum in the background,
and by concentrating you realize that it is the sound of many
voices joined together in song, chanting in unison as they 
proceed along the pathway to enlightenment. The song fills your
mind and you find yourself joining them with ease, and harmony
becomes one with your heart and soul.

Immense trees punctuate the thick, impenetrable brush that spreads as far

forefront of it all is a tree so enormous that it would take at least 10
large human men to completely encircle it.  The setting is so serene that it
feels as though the Gods are everywhere, just waiting for someone to try and
communicate with them.  Perhaps a short climb up the {ctree{x into the
clouds might be fun?

You've entered the oldest area of the herb gardens.  Here, there are many
pathways hidden among ivy-covered trellises, and marble benches clearly
intended for meditation (or at the very least, relaxation).  To one side,
you see a statue of a figure holding a small rabbit, while dogs romp happily
close by.  A bird rests casually on the shoulder of the statue, watching
your slow approach.  It does not appear to be afraid of you, and it seems as
though it was intelligently evaluating you based on looks alone.

The Living Room~
You find yourself standing on a carpet of dark green moss so soft that it
squishes between your toes.  You blink your eyes in amazement as you realize
that you're in someone's secret treehouse, perched in the uppermost fork of
an ancient banyan tree.  Green vines hang down all around you, and you hear
the chitter of animals below you and the cacophony of birds in the distance.
As the sunlight filters hazily down through the canopy, you catch a glimpse
through a gap in the branches, of the rainforest that surrounds you, and you
feel a sense of tranquility steal upon you and you wish you never had to
leave.

The Sacred Circle~
An azure glow surrounds you, as you step out into a field of
energy so pure, that it seems you are breathing it in and out
of your body instead of air. Your muscles begin to relax, and
your mind clears itself of all the tension and stress that has
been bothering you. You are aware of a hum in the background,
and by concentrating you realize that it is the sound of many
voices joined together in song, chanting in unison as they 
proceed along the pathway to enlightenment. The song fills your
mind and you find yourself joining them with ease, and harmony
becomes one with your heart and soul.
