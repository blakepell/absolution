Tetragon~
Tetragon is here, ready to slay all who dare try. 
~
Tetragon is a rather large dragon.  He protects those who need it, and slays 
those who are criminals.  Do not under estimate him.  He is quick, smart,  
and hard to scare.

The kirre hermit~
A scruffy-looking kirre with white fur is here.
~
A scruffy catlike creature with dirty white fur squats down next to you,
regarding you with clear blue eyes.  He's wearing a worn leather vest and
loose pants, and an odd assortment of trinkets are displayed on a cord
around his neck.  Among them you see a bottle cap, a key, a gold coin, and a
leather pouch.  He carries himself with a aura that is somehow both wise and
ignorant, and seems perfectly at home in the ruins of this city.

growler~
an angry growler~
An angry growler is snuffling around for food.
~
This strange beast is covered with thin, velvety dark fur.  It lumbers
along on four legs, but rises up to two legs to defend itself with its
forefeet.  Its huge claws and sharp teeth could cause some serious flesh
wounds, and the rippling muscles under the fur lead you to believe the
stories you've heard about them uprooting whole trees.

This creature looks like a really fat worm covered in sand.  It sits

squirming your way...  which really looks disgusting...  Maybe you should
just kill it for being revolting...

Rosalie's Cave of Wonders~
You are in a cave worn into the mountainside by centuries of erosion from
underground water.  The cave seems to nearly glow, and closer inspection
reveals that the walls are studded with large jewels, of all different
colours.  Light from somewhere above filters through them, giving the room a
stained-glass effect.  The sound of dripping echoes from somewhere deeper in
the cave.  All around you are half-unpacked boxes, and odd things like a
huge double-headed battle axe, an inflatable giraffe, and an amoeba cat. 
This could only be the dwelling space of Rosalie Trueheart.

The Town Commons~
This desolate fenced-in area was once the town commons, but any last hint of green grass and
freshly painted fences has been erased by the ravages of the plague. The open air is a welcome
change after the claustrophobic streets, but the air isn't much clearer here. The remnants of a
huge fire burn low here on the charred remains of those plague victims fortunate enough to
escape the living death of the disease. Truly a tragedy.

Descending~
The slope takes a rather alarming angle at this point, almost making
travellers upon it slide down whether they want to or not.  It's just solid
enough, and has enough rocky bumps and ridges, to be able to navigate safely
down at a slow enough pace.  The chittering of insects is, as always,
omnipresent, though there's the faint sound of something rumbling far down
below.  Not a particularly good sign.

No-Man's Land~
You are standing on uneven paving stones, in a plaza of a ruined city. 
Standing here, you feel naked and alone, bared to the elements.  Anyone
could be watching you from any of the ruined buildings around the plaza;
there's nothing to hide you from view of the gaping dark windows.  The weeds
growing between the stones brush your ankles, and over everything falls the
shadow of the ziggurat.  A low, broad building lies to the east.

This appears as if it had been some sort of gathering place.  A
brick-lined fire-pit in the center of the room holds ashes that are not as
old as the ruins seem to be.  The room is bereft of furniture, and part of
the ceiling has caved in on the far side of the room.

Trading Hall~
This room was once lined with shelves and pegs to display merchandise. 
Most of them have been destroyed, either from years of disuse or the looting
of thieves.  A smashed barrel sits in the corner; the liquid it once
contained has left a dark stain on the floor around it.  There is a doorway
leading to a dark room behind the counter to the north.

Back Room of a Trading Hall~
This room is full of row after row of tall shelves.  Huge roaches scuttle
away from you to the corners of the room, and empty sacks and crates are
strewn across the floor.  Anything of value from this place has long since
been taken.

Healer's House~
You step over the threshold into a small room.  Small bundles of dried
herbs still hang from the ceiling, and a wooden chair and table remain
intact against the wall.  A ladder leads up.  Over the doorway leading
north, some words are carved: "Wele rhe be thae passe t'shoulde."  The
language is old, perhaps forgotten, but somehow the meaning seems to hover
at the very edge of understanding...

Healer's House~
You have stepped into a small room empty except for a large pool in the
middle.  The surface of the water ripples slightly as bubbles break the
surface, and steam forms puffy clouds in the air.  There is an earthy,
slightly perfumed smell to the air, as if there might be something besides
water in the pool.

A Rooftop Garden~
You step up through a trapdoor in the floor.  Stretching out across the
roof is an overgrown tangle of plants.  Once, perhaps, they might have been
arranged in orderly rows, but now the different varieties have become
intermingled.  Gaps in the growth prove to be flat stepping stones, forming
a path through the garden.

Training Hall~
You are standing in a large room which smells musty and damp.  In each
wall are hooks which must've held something important, but now they're just
rusty.  As you look closer, you can see faded murals painted on the walls
between each set of hooks, depicting catlike people wielding various types
of weapons.  The wall to the south shows moves using a long bullwhip.  The
room continues east and north.

Old Arena~
You've stepped into a large oval with a crumbling, chinked stone wall
surrounding it.  The ground under your feet is sandy but firm.  The air
smells of dampness and the surrounding jungle, but underneath it is a
lingering smell, dark and disturbing: the smell of old blood.  The raised
seating on the far side, outside the wall, hints at an audience for this
practice arena that has long since passed on.  The arena continues on to the
south.

Mead Hall~
The thatch roof on this building has decayed into nothing; the sky is
visible through empty rafters.  Carved stone figures of catlike beings guard
the entrance, slowly crumbling back to the earth.  They are poised on the
verge of dancing, raising goblets high in celebration.  The remains of
benches are broken and scattered through the room, and you can see a
blackened ring to the south.
