the job.  Well, when he's not drinking.  He tends to do that a fair bit,
and although he has a fine taste, he's also known to abuse too.  Don't
worry, he never takes it out on the horses.

A Sonatarian~
A Sonatarian elf is scrying in one of the mirrors
~
This is a male Sonatarian.  He isn't wearing the robes of a prophet but
his eyes have the knowing look, and a slight sheen which gives away his
birthright.  He probably is weaker in his natural power, as he seems to need
to use incense to scry.

You begin to read a passage from the tome...  The Terratar are one of the
four races of Palankcaren.  During the first awakening, they were born of
the brown spark, and they were first among the Palankcarians to look upon
the land.  They live in large underground cities in the mountains to the
North of Palankcaren.  Unlike the Sonatar of the Monatar, they go weeks
without seeing the sky.  They often have an earthly look; dark rough skin;
dark haired; fire burning in their eyes.  As with all Palankcarians, they
have a racial power.  For Terratarians, they can control the elements.  The
extent to which they can do this varies with each citizenbut in general,
Terratarians are very strong in their power.

You open the tome and begin reading...  The Sonatar are one of the four
races of Palankcaren.  During the time of first awakening, they came from
the yellow spark.  They were first to gaze upon the sun, and have since made
it their worship.  Sonatar can 'see like the sun' allowing them to know all
that has, is, and will be.  As with all races, some people are very strong
in this power.  Such people are known as 'Prophets'.  Others can only use
their power as a form of advanced intuition...  These people are usually
just regular members of Sonatarian society.  They live primarily in great
temples in the western desert, but the Sonatarian province's capital is on
the Isle of the Prophets.

If you want to make some incense for us in scrying and prophecy,
you'll need to contact the chandler.  She can usually make anything, if
you bring her the parts.
You're going to need some rope which is covered in algae.
Some flowers of the Phoenix.
A thorn-covered Rose.
A piece of Wargwood.
 
And don't forget she'll need the recipe itself.  Enjoy, and thanks again for the horse.

The Portal Room~
Welcome to the world of Palankcaren.  You are in the capital city of the
country of Palankcaren, on the island of Farma in the lake of Aquamir.  The
city is built upon a mountain (Mt.  Lefardango, if you care to know) which
is the only thing on the island.  High up on the mountain top is the
Valocarian High Keep.  You are in a large room, with a Circle of Power
ingraved into the stones.  On one wall, a large circular pattern is carved,
with keystones all around.  This room is built as a focus for
interdimentional portal creation.  North, you see the streets of the city
surrounding the Valocarian High Keep.  You see a large sign which you should
probably look at if you are new to this world.

sign~
Welcome, visitor from another world.  We hope you enjoy our humble city. 
Hopefully you are in good shape, because you are about half-way up the
mountain-city.  Higher up are Temples to the four worships, and finally at
the summit is the Valocarian High Keep.  Lower down the mountain, the city
expands are more room becomes available, allowing for residences, and market
places.  Down at sea-level, you can charter a ship to leave the island, and
explore the mainland itself.  Some of our people are a little shy, and have
asked us to restrict your access on the mainland for now.  There are four
primary races in Palankcaren: The Monatar, Terratar, Sonatar and Solotar. 
We recommend you come up to the Valocarian High Keep at some point, and read
in the library about all four races.  This may perhaps give you some insight
into our culture and ways.  If you wish to return to your own world, please
come back here, and ask our representative to open the portal once more. 
-The Valocarian High Council

jail.  Most criminals are kept either down on the walls, or up higher in the
Valocarian High Keep, but this jail is build for especially for holding
stray Gliglantari.  To the east you see a square, and many carts are heading

A turn on Antro Road~
You have reached the corner of the road.  The pavement curves quickly
around the mountain, avoiding the cliff it was approaching.  You can see the
western shore of the lake in this distance, since no houses are at this
corner of the road.  Behind you, the mountain towers above.

On Antro Road~
You are on the western side of the mountain.  You appear to be
approaching a more commericalized and residential area.  There are houses
and shops along the street.  To the west is a much larger house.  Upon its
gate rests the skull of a dragon.  This must be the infamous dragonslayer's
house.  He isn't well liked by the other elves since elves and dragons have
a friendly relationship in this world.

You are walking along Antro Road.  There are many houses along the
street.  At this point, the street is made of pure gold, and the sidewalk
made of silver.  Far to the west, you see open skies, far above the lake
below.  To the east is a small guardhouse, where the guards patrol from.  To
the north, you make out a large mansion on the west side of the road, and
further south you see a large square.

Weapon's Square~
You are standing in a large square.  There is a nice fountain, with a
small garden around it.  To the west there is the Forge, and to the south
you see the Weaponsmith.  If you wish to buy weapons, the Weaponsmith is the
place to go, but he buys and repairs all his mechandise from the Forge to
the west, where you can get your weapons and armor repaired, if needed.  The
flagstones of the square are made of adamantium.  Throughout the square
small merchants are selling lesser weapons, none of which interest you. 
Antro Road starts to the north, and Stora road is east.

blacksmith's work are in a display case.  A large sign catches your eye.

sign~
Welcome to the Forge.  Feel free to look at the displays.  If it is
broken, I can fix it.  If you want it retooled, I can do that too.  Here is
what you need to do:I have trouble hearing over the noise of my hammer.  As
such, you'll need to speak up in short, easy to understand words.  When you
think you have all the parts you need for me to forge something together,
simply give them to me, and pay me a 50 gold forging fee.  I usually don't
notice that you're trying to get my attention unless you give me gold.  If
you've given me stuff that you want back, yell 'DROP IT' at the top of your
lungs, and I'll usually hear that.  
 
Oh, and I don't like invisible people.  Gives me the creeps.

bright, vibrant colours.  There are symbols of the sun everywhere you turn,

space, as most of the extra room is used up by desks or tables covered in
scrolls, maps, proclamations, and other documents.

alcoves around the rooms of the temple, to meditate in.  The floors are
simply decorated with rugs, and the walls have symbols of confidence and
trust.  Sometimes large numbers of Solotar will meet here together, and
meditate on commune, at other times, they will come to preform healing
rituals to those in need.

disk, hovering between two portal-anchoring stones.  Unlike the portal room
back to your world, this one has no circles of power to strengthen the
portal.  Palankcarians are experts of portal magic, and can maintain simple
portals easily.  This portal is a two-way transport back down to the
sea-level of the city.  It was built for the citizens, so that they wouldn't
have to climb the mountain if they wished to visit their temples.

Scrying Room~
You are in the scrying room used by the high Templar of the city.  There
are many large lenses on the ceiling, which will focus the light of the sun
directly into a huge scrying ball in the centre.  Aside from the temples of
Prophet's Island, this is one of the most powerful centres of Sunviewing
existant...  The Sonatar see like the Sun: all that has, is, and will be.

the Heart of Lefardango~
You are deep within the heart of the mountain.  This appears to be a
cavern, made from solid rock.  Upon each wall there is a large, glowing
stone.  Each stone is of a different colour, representing one of the four
races of Palankcaren.  From every stone, there is a line, flowing downwards,
towards the centre of the room.  The four lines spiral into the middle,
blending, mixing.  From this point, a large pillar of Blue flies upwards,
probably into the Valocarian Temple.  Built into one side of the wall, a
staircase leads downards.

Castle is made of a rare and magical substance, which reacts to the time of
day.  The Castle will always appear the colour of the sky, and hence the
name: at midnight, the castle is pitch black, and usually invisible.  During
the day, it is usually a blue or grey tone, but sometimes it can be pink or
purple, or orange, if the sun is bouncing of the clouds or setting in just
the right way.  The Castle is off limits to off-worlders such as yourself.

Clima Road~
You are on Clima Road.  The road is covered with gravel, which is
spilling out of the mine to your north.  There are a number of buildings in
front of the mine, among them a small administration buildling, along with a
bunch of workers lodgings.  Clima Road itself continues to the east and
west, while Kabe road starts to the south.

On Clima road~
Clima Road Circles the mountain here.  The mountain itself towers high
above you to the north.  If you wanted to go to the northern part of the
city, there is a tunnel running through the mountain here.  Clima road
itself continues east-west, along the mountain foot.  There are houses and
shops lining the road.

The Tunnel~
You are inside the tunnel.  It is long, and fairly dark.  Magical globes
hover every few metres, providing you with light in the eternal darkness. 
You think you hear footsteps behind you, and in front of you, but it is
probably your imagination.  The wall has arches every few meters, designed
to add support.  There could be anything hidden in the shadows, although you
aren't disturbed by them, the tunnel itself is rather cheerful.

of incense sticks, ready to be burned are neatly oraganized.  The Chandler

Kabe Road~
Kabe Road swings to the north here, to follow the eastern edge of the
island.  A city wall protects you from the lake a few kilometers to the
east.  Side streets run off in all directions, allowing access to people's
houses.  To the west, Kabe Road turns north again, towards the mine, passing
a residential area, and a few shops, such as the Chandler's.  To the east is
a large Portal Room.  The portal room is built to allow the populous quick
access up to the third level of the mountain, where their temples reside. 
Palankcarians are experts at portal magic, so such small distance portals
can be maintained permanently.  The Mountain towers above you to the north
west.

A Portal Room~
There is a small, but permanent portal in this room.  It is a circular
disk, hovering between two portal-anchoring stones.  Unlike the portal room
back to your world, this one has no circles of power to strengthen the
portal.  Palankcarians are experts of portal magic, and can maintain simple
portals easily.  This portal is a two-way transport back up to the temple
level of the city.  It was built for the citizens, so that they wouldn't
have to climb the mountain if they wished to visit their temples.

vaguely see a clearing between some buildings to the west, it is probably a
park or something.  You can see a little bridge climbing over a creek to the
north.  Farther south you see the portal room, leading high up onto the
mountain.  There are houses and other buildings along the street.

Outside the stable~
These are the royal stables of the Valocarian High Keep.  There are, in
fact, stables up at the Keep level of the mountain, but these are the less
formal, but much larger stables.  The King and Queen also keep a horse or
two here, although they have their own stables as well.  The horses are let
free and can wander into the stables as they wish.  They can't leave the
park though, but they are very friendly, and will allow children to ride
them if they aren't tired.  The stables themselves are rather ornately
built.  They have columns of gold, and silver horse emblems encircling each.
There are volunteers from the city who come and take care of the horses in
times of peace; in times of war, the soldiers from the Keep take control of
the stables once more.

the mountain, decending back to the city.  North, the keep itself is
majestic.  The keep is made of some unknown shimmering white substance.  It
is built directly into the peak of the mountain, and it is difficult to tell
where mountain ends and keep begins.  A small moat circles the keep.  You
are above cloud level now, and the white of the keep contrasts the pure blue
of the sky.  Looking over the keep once more, your eye catches windows
cleverly hidden among the rocks, and balconies.  Open terraces on cliff
ledges high above you.  The main gate is wide open, large enough for the
biggest dragon, in welcome.

You stand inside the foyer of the Valocarian High Keep, paralized in awe.
The ceiling is at least six stories high.  There are two staircases,
starting at the base of the room, and spiralling upwards, following the
wall.  Every so often, teh staircases will cross, or will stop for a
landing, door at every such pause.  High up on the ceiling, you can see
doors leading straight upwards; shortcuts for those who can fly.  People
scury into one tunnel, or out of another.  There are tunnels running in all
directions, right into the heart of the mountain.  Signs point out the
largest tunnels.  One points you to the Acolyte Wing, and to the Library,
east.  Another directs you to City Administration, west.  Otherwise give
directions to apartments and laboratories.  A final sign indicates that the
Valocarian High Council meets to the North.

the centre of the room, a large pillar of blue energy spirals and rotates
slowly, flowing from the ground upwards.  You wonder what room is above. 
There are tunnels heading off in various directions, leading to apartments
and laboratories of the various High Council members.  Occasionally an
Acolyte or perhaps a fully trained Valocar wanders through the room, going
from one passage to another.  Their footsteps echo in the silence caused by
the size of the room.

Down a tunnel into the Keep~
You have gone down one of the hallways into the Keep.  Large aches
illuminate the passage every few meters, making it impossible to tell day
from night.  There are doors all over the place, a veritable maze leading
you all around in circles.  You are afraid you may be getting your
directions crossed, but as long as you follow the main passages, you should
be fine.  Arriving at a corner, you see a large door on what you think is
the north side.  The passage goes south and east.

The Waiting Room~
You seem to be in some sort of waiting room.  There is a large fireplace
to one side, and a number of chairs all around it.  The fire seems to burn
without anything to burn...  No logs, no paper; it just hovers there.  There
is a small table to one side with refreshments laid out for anyone who may
want one.  This must be set up as the entrance room to the High Council
itself!  You can imagine many important plaintiffs must have waited here, to
plead their case before the {WValocarian High Council{x.  You move forward
and look out the window...  You are imediately taken aback by the height you
are at!  You had believed yourself to be at ground level, but you are at
least six stories above the ground!  Somewhere back in all those windy
tunnels, you must have somehow gone upwards...  Also, you are facing the
courtyard you came from...  You thought this room faced north, but aparently
it faced south!  You must have circled the entire Keep a few times to get up
this high!

The Entrance to the City Administration Wing~
You have travelled down a long narrow passage through the mountain.  The
halls leading up had strange runes on the walls, illuminating your way.  The
passage opens up into a two story rotunda.  Looking up and down the room,
there are desks at all levels.  Platforms seem to float in the sky, with
staircases leading up and down to them.  Desks with workers are doing
paperwork on these platforms...  Occasionally a page will float from one
desk to another.  You hear the scratching of quills on paper as Important
Documents are signed.  Down here on ground level, there is a large reception
desk, with some attendants waiting to help you.  A large door leads west,
deeper in to the Keep, and another leads South, to the Property Registry
Office.

The Property Registry~
Having walked through the doors, you are now in the Property Registry
Office.  Looking around, you are a bit disoriented.  You had thought you had
gone south, into another chamber but now you are actually on one of the
floating platforms, above the hall you had been in previously.  To the
direction you think is North, there is a Staircase leading downward.  In
front of you is a gold and marble desk.  Behind it sits a tall, female
Palankcarian, who looks up from some paperwork as you approach.  Behind her,
a window floats in mid air, which looks out upon the eastern shore of the
Island.

The Mayor's Office~
You are within one of the high spires of the Valocarian High Keep.  You
don't quite understand how you got here, as you are sure that the large
Administration rotunda you had just been in had been floors below, and
certainly not in a tower.  The office itself is very well decorated.  A
fresco depicts the city, while on the south wall, there is a very detailed
map of the city with pins at various intersections and shops.  Strangely,
there is no desk here, but instead a few chairs arranged around a fireplace.
Light shines in through the diamond-shaped window.

A Tunnel Towards the Library~
This is a narrow tunnel that leads into the keep.  There are doors
leading off on all sides leading to who knows where...  All of them are
locked.  Every so often, an Arch holds up the ceiling.  It glows with a
calming white light.  West, you can still make out the gigantic room that is
the entrance to the keep, and east, you can see another domed chamber.

A Large Dommed Chamber~
You are in a large dommed room.  Looking up at the ceiling, you can see
the sky, as if the rock just wasn't there.  There are tunnels and chambers
running off in all directions.  You see many Acolytes scurrying around,
trying not to be late for lessons.  Sometimes you'll see one try to use some
form of magic on another, but instructors quickly cause the offenders to
vanish somewhere for discipline.  A large passage to the north has a sign
indicating that it leads towards the Acolyte chambers, and in the centre of
the room is a magical platform, which seems to raise up into the ceiling. 
It probably leads to the library.

The Library~
You are standing in a vast library.  You have no idea where this must be
located within the Keep, but you don't remember seeing it from the outside. 
There is a magical platform in the centre of the room, which descends down
into the room below.  The library itself seems...  Alive.  There are trees
growing everywhere, with books hanging from them, and leaves with titles or
directions.  There appears to be...  Clearnings in the forest in all the
cardinal directions.  Along the walls, you can see vines with yet more books
growing off them.  When you...  Pluck a book, it comes off easily, and a new
one grows in its place.  Once you put the book down, it seems to wilt and
decompose back into Earth.  You see some Gardeners?  Librarians?  taking
care of the trees.  None pay you any attention.

This is a small entryway into the Acolyte wing.  There are large windows
looking out of the keep, through which you can see a storm brewing.  The
structural arches, holding the ceiling up, glow, illuminating the room.  A
Guard bearing the crest of the Valocar guards the way north.  South, you can
hear noise from that large room, and north, Acolytes stream in and out of
the doors into their section.

The Terratarian Wing of the Library~
You have entered the Terratarian Wing of the Library.  The book-trees
still grow all around, but there is a small pond, and a small flame burns at
its centre.  The air here is muggy from all the moisture.  A cool wind
russles the leaves in the trees.  On a pedestal at the end of the room, a
large Tome sits open.  A book hanging from the tree catches your eye.  It is
labelled Book of Fire.

You pluck the book and begin reading at a random page.......
The Terratarian suspended fire is among their better-kept secrets.  Although
the preperation for it is common knowledge, only a true Terratar, and a strong
one at that, can produce the effect.  Most of the other races are often in
awe of their ability to cause flames to freeze and to not burn water, nor
waver in air, but the practicality of this technique remains a Terratarian
secret... 
You skip ahead a bit...  Water from the lake Aquamir.  Flame from
the Isle of the Prophets, Bottled Wind of Rak'delru, and a handful of dirt
fromthe Isle of Aquamir.  
  Take these to a High Priest, and hope they will help you.

The Monatarian Wing of the Library~
You are in the monotarian wing of the library.  The book-trees are
present here too, but they are much wider.  You can barely wrap your arms
around the trunk of the largest trees.  The leaves of the book-trees all
have a sliver underside in this section.  Looking up at the ceiling, you
notice that stars are subtly glowing in various constellations.  Near the
end of the room, you notice a large Tome on a pedestal.  Looking at the
books growing nearby, you notice one has the word 'Elkonir' in the title.  
Another book is entitled 'The Tear of the Moon'

Plucking the book, you begin to read.  Flipping ahead, you find

"Elkonir are from the sky, of this much we are sure.  Yet we do
not know why, when under focused moonlight, they transform into
the gem known as a "Moon's Tear"...

more brightly, and has additional properties."

This is the private library of the Valocar.  There are a few rock
outcroppings that take the shape of tables.  Large windows look out in all
directions over Palankcaren.  The book-trees are carefully planted in neat
rows in this chamber, unlike the main library below.  Some of the trees look
older than the Keep itself.  In one corner, a large Tome sits on a pedestal.
A few other books of note are scattered around the room.

Unlike some of the other entrance halls, this one is not four stories
high and decorated for a king.  Instead, it is rather plain, with signs
leading around.  It is the Acolyte wing, where young Valocar come to train
for Guardianship.  Sometimes the Valocar will accept foreigners among their
ranks, but always under the understanding that will never be Guardians, only
learn the Guardian ways.  A number of would-be acolytes are lined up against
one wall, waiting to enter a door to the north.  West, look down into a very
long corridor, leading deep into the keep.  A sign indicates that east leads
into the Acolyte residence.

paths.  Often there are exits leading "up" or "down", but since you seem to

doors in and out of the room are locked, and the windows look out into a
