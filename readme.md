### Absolution

It's not about redemption.

This is based on some (incomplete) redemption code from back in the day... absent a lot of recent changes.  Right now, the game compiles and boots, but a lot is broken!  I had to comment out all mobprog stuff to get it to run (missing files, maybe?), and once you login (you can create a character) no commands work... so there's that!
